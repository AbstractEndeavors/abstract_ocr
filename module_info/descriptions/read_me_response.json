The module's details are as follows:\n\n**Module Metadata:**\n{'name': 'abstract_ocr', 'version': '0.0.1.1', 'author': 'putkoff', 'author_email': 'partners@abstractendeavors.com', 'description': 'abstract_ocr', 'long_description': '', 'long_description_content_type': 'text/markdown', 'package_dir': {'': 'src'}, 'packages': [], 'classifiers': ['Development Status :: 3 - Alpha', 'Intended Audience :: Developers', 'Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries', 'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License', 'Programming Language :: Python :: 3', 'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6', 'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7', 'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8', 'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9'], 'install_requires': ['abstract_utilities', 'requests'], 'python_requires': '>=3.6', 'setup_requires': ['wheel']}\n\n**Complete Synopsis of Scripts:**\n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Abstract_OCR_Init_Module_Overview\n was described as: The __init__.py file from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 is loading several utility modules. The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: SEO_Optimization_and_Keyword_Extraction_Functions_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This portion of text_utils.py in the abstract_ocr package imports several functions and utilizes some of these to define new functions for text processing. The script loads the English model of spaCy for natural language processing and defines a function generate_with_bigbird to generate SEO-optimized titles, captions, descriptions, and abstracts using the pretrained BigBird model provided by the Hugging Face's Transformer library. A media URL generator is also defined, which can take a file system path and return a relative media URL for the file. Two other functions for keyword extraction are provided: get_keybert uses the pretrained KeyBERT model to extract key phrases by accepting a text string and adjustable parameters such as top_n (number of key phrases to return) and diversity (to diversify the resulting keywords), and extract_keywords_nlp applies part of speech tagging to extract most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Setting_Up_Main_Run_Environment_for_Abstract_OCR_Transcribe_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the \\'transcribe_utils.py\\' file from the \\'abstract_ocr\\' package. This file mainly imports necessary modules like text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, ocr_utils. These modules likely contain functions and tools related to their areas such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, SEO-related actions for seo_utils, and optical character recognition for ocr_utils. This script also imports two specific transcription-related functions from \\'audio_utils_clean.py\\'. Additionally, the script clears the root logger handlers, likely to prevent duplicate console output in the running environment. Overall, this script plays a critical role in setting up the main run environment for the OCR-related package by importing necessary modules and preparation.\n\n/n/n\n\n**Module Directory:**\n{'name': 'abstract_ocr', 'version': '0.0.1.1', 'author': 'putkoff', 'author_email': 'partners@abstractendeavors.com', 'description': 'abstract_ocr', 'long_description': '', 'long_description_content_type': 'text/markdown', 'package_dir': {'': 'src'}, 'packages': [], 'classifiers': ['Development Status :: 3 -

Create a detailed README in Markdown format that includes:\n     - **Module Name and Version**: Derived from metadata (e.g., `name` and `version`).\n     - **Description**: A clear, high-level overview of the module's purpose and functionality, synthesizing the metadata description and script synopses.\n     - **Features**: A bulleted list of key features or capabilities, inferred from the script synopses and metadata.\n     - **Installation**: Instructions for installing the module, referencing dependencies from metadata (`install_requires`).\n     - **Usage**: A brief example or explanation of how to use the module, based on the script functionalities and entry points (if any).\n     - **Dependencies**: List the dependencies from metadata (`install_requires`).\n     - **License**: Include the license information from metadata.\n     - **Author**: Include the author and contact information (e.g., `author`, `author_email`).\n     - **Contributing**: A brief note encouraging contributions and pointing to the source repository (if applicable).\n     - **Scripts Overview**: A section summarizing the purpose of each script, using the `complete_synopsis` to highlight their roles within the module.\n   - Ensure the README is professional, well-organized, and suitable for a public-facing repository (e.g., GitHub).\n\n2. **Short Description:**\n   - Provide a concise description (2-3 sentences) summarizing the module's purpose and key functionality.\n   - This description should be suitable for use in a `setup.py` file, PyPI listing, or as a tagline.\n   - Base it on the metadata description and the synthesized insights from the script synopses.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Synthesize the script synopses to avoid redundancy while capturing the module's overall functionality.\n- Use the metadata to ensure accuracy in technical details (e.g., version, dependencies, license).\n- If metadata fields are missing, infer reasonable defaults or note that information is unavailable.\n- Ensure the tone is professional, clear, and engaging for developers.\n- Avoid including sensitive information (e.g., API keys, internal paths).\n- If specific script details are unclear, provide a general interpretation based on the synopsis and context.\n\n**Output Format:**\nReturn the response in JSON format with two keys:\n- `readme`: The full README content as a string in Markdown format.\n- `short_description`: The short description as a string.\n\nExample Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"readme\": \"# ModuleName\n\n## Description\n...\n## Installation\n...\n\",\n  \"short_description\": \"A Python module for doing X, with features Y and Z.\"\n}\n```\n"
