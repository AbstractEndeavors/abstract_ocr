 in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py
 dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1
 was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\n\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as "get_image_metadata" and "sort_frames", are used for processing image files, while others like "generate_file_id" and "update_json_data" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.
