 dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR
 was described as: The script provided ("audio_utils.py") in the package "abstract_ocr" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local "functions" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) "get_audio_duration" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) "transcribe_audio_file_clean" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) "chunk_fixed" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) "chunk_on_silence" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) "transcribe_in_chunks" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) "transcribe_with_whisper_local" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) "export_srt_whisper" & "export_srt" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.
