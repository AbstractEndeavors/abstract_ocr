 was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package "abstract_ocr". This file imports all functions from ".functions", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.
