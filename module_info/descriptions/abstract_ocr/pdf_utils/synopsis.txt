 in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py
 dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR
 was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.

It starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.

The defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.
