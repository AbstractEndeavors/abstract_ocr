 dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR
 was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.
