 was described as: The provided script comes from "video_utils.py", part of the package "abstract_ocr" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\n\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \n\n1) "determine_remove_text": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\n\n2) "extract_hash_tags": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\n\n3) "get_title_description": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\n\n4) "is_frame_analyzed": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\n\n5) "analyze_video_text": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\n\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.
