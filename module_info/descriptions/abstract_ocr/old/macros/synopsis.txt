 in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py
 dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros
 was described as: The provided script "macros.py" from the package "abstract_ocr" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named "videoPathManager". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as "os", "pathlib", "shutil", "hashlib", and custom function like "safe_read_from_json", "safe_dump_to_file".\n\nA key element in this script is the class "videoPathManager", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the "get_video_path" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\n\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the "abstract_ocr" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.
