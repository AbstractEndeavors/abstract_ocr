 in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py
 dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1
 was described as: The script "audio_utils_old.py" is part of the "abstract_ocr" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include "os", "glob", "logging", "json", "spacy", "SpeechRecognition", and "pydub". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \n\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is "transcribe_audio_file", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \n\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.
