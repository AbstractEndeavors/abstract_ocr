 dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature
 was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as "moviepy.editor", "speech_recognition", and "pydub". \n\nThe primary routines include "get_audio_chunk" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; "get_text" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\'s Speech Recognition; "get_chunks" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; "get_chunk_period" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\'s transcribed; "get_audio_text" and "get_audio_text_data" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\n\nThe script also includes helper methods like "get_elapsed_time", "get_time_diff", and "check_if_transcribed_block" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function "get_audio_text_jsons" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.
