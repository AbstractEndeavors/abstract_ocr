 dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR
 was described as: The provided script chunk is part of "audio_utils_clean.py", from the "abstract_ocr" package. \n\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \n\n1) "transcribe_audio_file_clean" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\n\n2) "chunk_fixed" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\n\n3) "chunk_on_silence" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\n\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.
