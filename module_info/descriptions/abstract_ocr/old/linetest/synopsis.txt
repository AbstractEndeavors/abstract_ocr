 in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py
 dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR
 was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\n\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\n\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\n\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\n\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\n\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\n\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.
