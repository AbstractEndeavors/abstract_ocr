 in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py
 dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR
 was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.
