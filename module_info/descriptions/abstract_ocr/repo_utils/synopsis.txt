 in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py
 dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR
 was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \n\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.
