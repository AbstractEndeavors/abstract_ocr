 dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1
 was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \`refine_with_gpt\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \`generate_with_bigbird\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \`get_keybert\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \`get_keybert\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \`extract_keywords_nlp\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.
