 in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py
 dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1
 was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.
