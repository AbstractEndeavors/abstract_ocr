 in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py
 dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1
 was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.
