 in the script: src/old/text_utils.py
 dubbed with the title: SEO_Optimization_and_Keyword_Extraction_Functions_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1
 was described as: This portion of text_utils.py in the abstract_ocr package imports several functions and utilizes some of these to define new functions for text processing. The script loads the English model of spaCy for natural language processing and defines a function generate_with_bigbird to generate SEO-optimized titles, captions, descriptions, and abstracts using the pretrained BigBird model provided by the Hugging Face's Transformer library. A media URL generator is also defined, which can take a file system path and return a relative media URL for the file. Two other functions for keyword extraction are provided: get_keybert uses the pretrained KeyBERT model to extract key phrases by accepting a text string and adjustable parameters such as top_n (number of key phrases to return) and diversity (to diversify the resulting keywords), and extract_keywords_nlp applies part of speech tagging to extract most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.
