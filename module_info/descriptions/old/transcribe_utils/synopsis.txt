 dubbed with the title: Setting_Up_Main_Run_Environment_for_Abstract_OCR_Transcribe_Utils_Chunk_1
 was described as: The provided script is a part of the \'transcribe_utils.py\' file from the \'abstract_ocr\' package. This file mainly imports necessary modules like text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, ocr_utils. These modules likely contain functions and tools related to their areas such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, SEO-related actions for seo_utils, and optical character recognition for ocr_utils. This script also imports two specific transcription-related functions from \'audio_utils_clean.py\'. Additionally, the script clears the root logger handlers, likely to prevent duplicate console output in the running environment. Overall, this script plays a critical role in setting up the main run environment for the OCR-related package by importing necessary modules and preparation.
