 in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py
 dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR
 was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package "abstract_ocr" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.
