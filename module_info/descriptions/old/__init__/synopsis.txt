 in the script: src/old/__init__.py
 dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1
 was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package "abstract_ocr" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the "abstract_ocr" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.
