 in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py
 dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1
 was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.
