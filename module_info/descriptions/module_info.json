The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.",

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields.

It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a

The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 1\n\nfrom .functions import (clean_text,\n                        re,\n                        write_to_file,\n                        cv2,np,\n                        pytesseract,\n                        Image,\n                        sort_frames,\n                        get_all_file_types,\n                        os,\n                        is_media_type)\ndef preprocess_for_ocr(image_path: str) -> np.ndarray:\n    img = cv2.imread(image_path)\n    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)    # Enhance contrast\n    clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8, 8))\n    contrast = clahe.apply(gray)    # Denoise\n    denoised = cv2.bilateralFilter(contrast, d=9, sigmaColor=75, sigmaSpace=75)    # Thresholding\n    thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(\n        denoised,\n        255,\n        cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C,\n        cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV,\n        blockSize=11,\n        C=2\n    )\n    # Sharpen\n    kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)\n    morph = cv2.dilate(thresh, kernel, iterations=1)    \n    sharpen_kernel = np.array([[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 9, -1], [-1, -1, -1]])\n    sharpened = cv2.filter2D(thresh, -1, sharpen_kernel)    return sharpened\ndef extract_text_from_image(image_path: str) -> str:\n    try:\n        processed_img = preprocess_for_ocr(image_path)\n        pil_img = Image.fromarray(cv2.bitwise_not(processed_img))  # invert for OCR\n        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(pil_img, lang='eng')\n        return text\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"[OCR Error] {e}\")\n        return \"\"\ndef is_frame_analyzed(frame_file,video_text_data):\n    for values in video_text_data:\n        frame = values\n        if isinstance(values,dict):\n            frame = values.get(\"frame\")\n        if frame_file == frame:\n            return True\ndef extract_image_text(image_path,remove_phrases=None):\n    remove_phrases = remove_phrases or []\n    if is_media_type(image_path,media_types=['image']):\n        raw_text = extract_text_from_image(image_path)\n        cleaned_text = clean_text(raw_text)\n        text = determine_remove_text(cleaned_text,remove_phrases=info_data['remove_phrases'])\n        return text\ndef extract_text_from_frame(image_path,image_texts,remove_phrases=None):\n    basename = os.path.basename(image_path)\n    if not is_frame_analyzed(basename,image_texts):\n        text = extract_image_text(image_path,remove_phrases)\n        if text:\n            image_texts.append( {\"frame\": basename, \"text\": text})\n    return image_texts\ndef extract_image_texts_from_directory(directory,image_texts=None,remove_phrases=None):\n    image_texts = image_texts or []\n    image_files = get_all_file_types(types=['image'],directory=directory)\n    for i,image_path in enumerate(image_files):\n        image_texts = extract_text_from_frame(image_path,image_texts)\n        \n    image_texts = sort_frames(image_texts)\n    return image_textsdef download_pdf(url: str, output_path: str):\n    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        with open(output_path, \"wb\") as file:\n            for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):\n                file.write(chunk)\n        print(f\"PDF downloaded successfully: {output_path}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Failed to download PDF.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application.

It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis).

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files.

The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 2\n\ndef transcribe_in_chunks(\n    audio_path: str,\n    model_size: str      = \"medium\",\n    language: Optional[str] = None,\n    use_silence: bool    = True,\n    info_data = None,\n    # parameters for fixed chunking:\n    chunk_length_s: int  = 30,\n    overlap_s: int       = 5,\n    # parameters for silence chunking:\n    min_silence_len: int = 700,\n    keep_silence: int    = 300\n) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transcribe by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results.\n    \"\"\"\n    info_data =info_data or {}\n    model = whisper.load_model(model_size)\n    output_dir = info_data.get('info_dir') or info_data.get('info_directory') or info_data.get('output_directory') or info_data.get('directory') or os.getcwd()\n    audio_dir = os.path.join(output_dir,'audio')\n    os.makedirs(audio_dir,exist_ok=True)\n    full_text = []\n    if use_silence:\n        segments = chunk_on_silence(\n            audio_path,\n            min_silence_len=min_silence_len,\n            keep_silence=keep_silence\n        )\n        audio_paths  = []\n        for i, seg in enumerate(segments):\n            audio_path = os.path.join(audio_dir,f\"chunk_{i}.wav\")\n            audio_paths.append(audio_path)\n            seg.export(audio_path, format=\"wav\")\n            res = model.transcribe(audio_path, language=language)\n            full_text.append(res[\"text\"].strip())\n            if audio_path and os.path.isfile(audio_path):\n                os.remove(audio_path)\n        shutil.rmtree(audio_dir)\n        for audio_path in audio_paths:\n            if audio_path and os.path.isfile(audio_path):\n                os.remove(audio_path)\n        \n    else:\n        audio = whisper.load_audio(audio_path)  # returns np.ndarray\n        # no need to pad/trim if chunking manually\n        chunks = chunk_fixed(\n            audio, SAMPLE_RATE,\n            chunk_length_s=chunk_length_s,\n            overlap_s=overlap_s\n        )\n        for chunk in chunks:\n            res = model.transcribe(chunk, language=language)\n            full_text.append(res[\"text\"].strip())\n    result = {\"text\":\" \".join(full_text).strip()}\n    info_data[\"whisper_result\"] = result\n    return info_data\ndef transcribe_with_whisper_local(\n    audio_path: str,\n    model_size: str = \"tiny\",           # one of \"tiny\", \"base\", \"small\", \"medium\", \"large\"\n    language: str = \"english\",\n    use_silence=False,\n    info_data=None):\n    info_data =info_data or {}\n    # parameters for fixed chunki)\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the full transcript as a string.\n    \"\"\"\n    model = whisper.load_model(model_size)           # loads to GPU if available\n    # options: you can pass `task=\"translate\"` for translating to English\n \n    result = model.transcribe(audio_path, language=language)\n    info_data[\"whisper_result\"] = result\n    return info_data\n"

The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 2\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os\nimport glob\nimport logging\nimport json\nimport os,sys,spacy\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\nimport speech_recognition as sr\nfrom abstract_utilities import *\nfrom moviepy.editor import *\nimport moviepy.editor as mp\nfrom pydub import AudioSegment\nfrom datetime import timedelta\nfrom .video_utils import derive_all_video_meta\n\nlogger = get_logFile('vid_to_aud')\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    level=logging.INFO,\n    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',\n    handlers=[\n        logging.FileHandler('vid_to_aud.log'),\n        logging.StreamHandler()\n    ]\n)\n\n# Initialize recognizer\nr = sr.Recognizer()\n\n\n\n\ndef create_key_value(json_obj,key,value):\n    if key not in json_obj:\n        json_obj[key]=value\n    return json_obj\ndef transcribe_audio_file(audio_path, json_data, chunk_length_ms=60000,summarizer=None):\n    \"\"\"Transcribe audio file in chunks and save as text and time-blocked JSON.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        logging.info(f\"Transcribing audio: {audio_path}\")\n        audio = AudioSegment.from_wav(audio_path)\n        chunks = [audio[i:i + chunk_length_ms] for i in range(0, len(audio), chunk_length_ms)]\n        full_text = \"\"\n        json_data = create_key_value(json_data,'audio_text',[])\n        file_path = json_data['info_path']\n        for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n            start_time = i * chunk_length_ms\n            end_time = min((i + 1) * chunk_length_ms, len(audio))\n            chunk_path = f\"chunk_{i}.wav\"\n            chunk.export(chunk_path, format=\"wav\")\n            logging.info(f\"Processing chunk {i+1}/{len(chunks)} ({format_timestamp(start_time)} - {format_timestamp(end_time)})\")\n        \n            with sr.AudioFile(chunk_path) as source:\n                r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)\n                audio_data = r.record(source)\n                try:\n                    text = r.recognize_google(audio_data)\n                    full_text += text + \" \"\n                    json_data['audio_text'].append({\n                        \"start_time\": format_timestamp(start_time),\n                        \"end_time\": format_timestamp(end_time),\n                        \"text\": text\n                    })\n                except sr.UnknownValueError:\n                    logging.warning(f\"Chunk {i+1} could not be transcribed.\")\n                    json_data['audio_text'].append({\n                        \"start_time\": format_timestamp(start_time),\n                        \"end_time\": format_timestamp(end_time),\n                        \"text\": \"\"\n                    })\n                except sr.RequestError as e:\n                    logging.error(f\"API error for chunk {i+1}: {e}\")\n                    json_data['audio_text'].append({\n                        \"start_time\": format_timestamp(start_time),\n                        \"end_time\": format_timestamp(end_time),\n                        \"text\": \"\"\n                    })\n                safe_dump_to_file(data=json_data,file_path=json_path) \n            os.remove(chunk_path)  # Clean up chunk file\n\n        # Save plain text\n        if full_text:\n            full_text = full_text.strip()\n        text_result= get_voice(full_text, text=full_text)\n        json_data = create_key_value(json_data,'full_text',text_result)\n        json_data = create_key_value(json_data,'summary',None)\n        json_data = create_key_value(json_data,'keywords',extract_keywords_nlp(text_result))\n        if summarizer:\n            try:\n                json_data['summary'] = summarizer(text_result, max_length=160, min_length=40)\n            except Exception as e:\n                logging.error(f\"Error getting summary for {json_data['filename']}: {e}\")\n        \n        return json_data\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(f\"Error transcribing {audio_path}: {e}\")\n        return json_data\n\n\n\n"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package.

This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 3\n\n    # Expand the line boundaries to the nearest gap or image edge\n    upper_bound = 0\n    lower_bound = height    # Find the nearest gap above group_start\n    for gap_start, gap_end in gaps:\n        if gap_end <= group_start:\n            upper_bound = max(upper_bound, gap_end)\n        if gap_start >= group_end:\n            lower_bound = min(lower_bound, gap_start)\n            break    line_boundaries.append((upper_bound, lower_bound))# Step 9: Crop and save each line\nfor i, (start_y, end_y) in enumerate(line_boundaries):\n    if end_y - start_y < 5:  # Skip very small lines\n        continue    # Crop the line from the original image\n    line_image = image[start_y:end_y, :]    # Save the cropped line\n    output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, f\"line_{i+1}.png\")\n    cv2.imwrite(output_path, line_image)    # Draw a line on the original image to mark the boundary\n    cv2.line(image, (0, start_y), (image.shape[1], start_y), (0, 255, 0), 1)\n    cv2.line(image, (0, end_y), (image.shape[1], end_y), (0, 0, 255), 1)# Step 10: Save the annotated image\ncv2.imwrite(\"annotated_image.png\", image)print(f\"Separated {len(line_boundaries)} lines.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description.

It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 7\n\nfrom typing import Dict, Any, Optional\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport os\nimport shutil\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport unicodedata\nimport re\nimport hashlib\nfrom abstract_utilities import safe_read_from_json, safe_dump_to_file, get_logFile\n\n# Constants\nBASE_URL = \"https://typicallyoutliers.com\"\nTEXT_DIR = '/var/www/typicallyoutliers/frontend/public/repository/text_dir/'\nVIDEO_DIR = '/var/www/typicallyoutliers/frontend/public/repository/Video/'\nDIR_LINKS = {TEXT_DIR: 'infos', VIDEO_DIR: 'videos'}\nlogger = get_logFile('video_utils')\n\nclass videoPathManager:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.video_paths = []\n        self.video_ids = os.listdir(TEXT_DIR) if os.path.exists(TEXT_DIR) else []\n        self.video_directories = self.get_all_video_paths()\n\n    def get_all_video_paths(self) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]:\n        video_directories = {\n            video_id: {\"directory\": os.path.join(TEXT_DIR, video_id)}\n            for video_id in self.video_ids\n        }\n        for video_id in video_directories:\n            info_path = os.path.join(video_directories[video_id][\"directory\"], 'info.json')\n            info_data = safe_read_from_json(info_path) or {}\n            video_directories[video_id]['video_path'] = info_data.get('video_path', '')\n        return video_directories\n\n    def get_video_path(self, video_id: str) -> Optional[str]:\n        return self.video_directories.get(video_id, {}).get('video_path')"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description.

It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 6 of 7\n\n        # Step 2: Populate video data with existing or default values\n        video_data[\"id\"] = video_id\n        video_data[\"video_url\"] = info_data.get(\"video_url\", get_link(info_data.get(\"video_path\", \"\")) or \"\")\n        video_data[\"contentUrl\"] = video_data[\"video_url\"]\n        video_data[\"optimized_video_url\"] = video_data[\"video_url\"]\n        video_data[\"publication_date\"] = info_data.get(\"publication_date\", datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\"))\n        video_data[\"audio_text\"] = info_data.get(\"audio_text\", [])\n        video_data[\"transcript\"] = info_data.get(\"transcript\", \"\")\n        video_data[\"description\"] = info_data.get(\"seo_description\", \"Check out this video\")\n        video_data[\"title\"] = info_data.get(\"seo_title\", \"Untitled Video\")\n        video_data[\"keywords_str\"] = info_data.get(\"keywords_str\", \"\")\n        video_data[\"schema_markup\"] = info_data.get(\"schema_markup\", {})\n        video_data[\"social_meta\"] = info_data.get(\"social_meta\", {})\n        video_data[\"file_metadata\"] = info_data.get(\"file_metadata\", {})\n        video_data[\"thumbnail_metadata\"] = info_data.get(\"thumbnail_metadata\", {})\n        video_data[\"thumbnail_url\"] = info_data.get(\"thumbnail_url\", \"/var/www/typicallyoutliers/frontend/public/imgs/no_image.jpg\")\n        video_data[\"captions\"] = info_data.get(\"captions\", None)"

The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis).

It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally.

It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 7 of 7\n\n        # Set extension and mime type\n        if video_data[\"video_url\"]:\n            _, ext = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(video_data[\"video_url\"]))\n            video_data[\"ext\"] = ext\n            video_data[\"mime_type\"] = \"video/mp4\" if ext == \".mp4\" else \"video/webm\" if ext == \".webm\" else \"video/unknown\"        # Step 3: Save updated info_data if changed\n        if any(\n            info_data.get(key) != video_data.get(key)\n            for key in [\"video_url\", \"audio_text\", \"transcript\", \"thumbnail_url\", \"file_metadata\", \"thumbnail_metadata\", \"schema_markup\", \"social_meta\"]\n        ):\n            safe_dump_to_file(info_data, info_data[\"info_path\"])    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error processing video {video_id or video_path}: {str(e)}\")\n        video_data[\"error\"] = str(e)    return video_data\nvideo_path = '/home/computron/mnt/webserver/typicallyoutliers/backend/typicallyoutliers_flask/functions/videos/Charlotte Gerson Interviewed on Cancer & Medical Industry Fraud 1_5/Charlotte Gerson Interviewed on Cancer & Medical Industry Fraud 1_5.mp4'data = get_complete_video_data(video_path)\ninput(data)\n"

The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment.

It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 14\n\nimport cv2,pytesseract,os,shutil,logging,spacy,json,re\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Set level to INFO or higher\nfrom .ocr_utils import *\nfrom moviepy.editor import *\nimport numpy as np\nfrom abstract_utilities import eatAll,safe_read_from_json,safe_dump_to_file,eatAll,make_dirs\nfrom collections import Counter\n# Load spaCy model (run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` first if not installed)\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\ndef determine_remove_text(text,remove_phrases=None):\n    remove_phrases=remove_phrases or []\n    found = False\n    for remove_phrase in remove_phrases:\n        if remove_phrase in text:\n            found = True\n            break\n    if found == False:\n        return text\ndef split_it_out(obj1,obj2):\n    obj_3=obj2\n    if obj2 and obj1 and obj1.lower() in obj2.lower():\n        start =0\n        obj_3=''\n        obj2_spl = obj2.lower().split(obj1.lower())\n        len_obj1 = len(obj1)\n        for each in obj2_spl:\n            end = start+len(each)\n            obj_3 += obj2[start:end]\n            start +=len_obj1+len(each)\n    return obj_3\ndef extract_hash_tags(strings):\n    hash_tags = []\n    hashtags = strings.split('#')\n    for hashtag in hashtags:\n        hashtag = f\"#{hashtag.split(' ')[0]}\"\n        strings = split_it_out(hashtag,strings)\n        hash_tags.append(hashtag[1:])\n    return strings,hash_tags\ndef get_title_description(string,leng = 65):\n    # If the string is 40 characters or less, return it as title with empty description\n    if len(string) <= leng:\n        return string, \"\"\n    \n    # Define separators to try splitting on\n    separators = ['.', '!', ':', '|', ' ']\n    \n    # Try each separator\n    for sep in separators:\n        parts = string.split(sep)\n        if len(parts) > 1:  # If the separator exists and splits the string\n            title = \"\"\n            for i, part in enumerate(parts):\n                # Build the title incrementally\n                potential_title = sep.join(parts[:i + 1]) if i > 0 else part\n                if len(potential_title) <= leng:\n                    title = potential_title\n                else:\n                    # If adding the next part exceeds 40, use the last valid title\n                    if title:  # Ensure we have a title\n                        description = sep.join(parts[i:]).strip()\n                        # Include the separator in the title if it fits\n                        if len(title + sep) <= leng:\n                            title += sep\n                        return title, description\n                    else:\n                        # No separator found within 40 yet, continue to next separator\n                        break\n    \n    # If no separators are found within 40 characters, return full string as title\n    # and empty description (since we don't want to cut mid-word)\n    return string, \"\"\ndef is_frame_analyzed(frame_file,video_text_data):\n    for values in video_text_data:\n        frame = values.get(\"frame\")\n        if frame_file == frame:\n            text = values.get(\"text\")\n            if text:\n                return True\n            return False\ndef analyze_video_text(video_path,output_dir=None,json_data=None,remove_phrases=None):\n    remove_phrases=remove_phrases or []\n    dirname = os.path.dirname(video_path)\n    basename = os.path.basename(video_path)\n    filename,ext = os.path.splitext(basename)\n    json_data =json_data or {}\n    output_dir = output_dir or os.path.join(dirname,'./frames')\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 14\n\n    # Load the video\n    video = VideoFileClip(video_path)\n    duration = video.duration"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 14\n\n    # Extract frames every 1 second\n    frame_interval = 1  # Adjust as needed\n    for t in range(0, int(duration), frame_interval):\n        \n        frame_path = f\"{output_dir}/{filename}_frame_{t}.jpg\"\n        if not os.path.isfile(frame_path):\n            frame = video.get_frame(t)\n            cv2.imwrite(frame_path, cv2.cvtColor(np.array(frame), cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR))"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 6 of 14\n\n    # Step 1: Preprocess the data\n    def preprocess_text(text):\n        # Remove special characters, normalize case, and fix common OCR errors\n        text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s@]', '', text).strip().lower()\n        return text"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 7 of 14\n\n    # Extract phrase frequencies\n    phrase_counts = {preprocess_text(phrase): info[\"count\"] for phrase, info in data.items()}\n    def extract_keywords_nlp(data, top_n=5):\n        # Combine all phrases into a single text, weighted by count\n        combined_text = \" \".join([preprocess_text(phrase) * info[\"count\"] for phrase, info in data.items()])\n        \n        # Process with spaCy\n        doc = nlp(combined_text)\n        \n        # Extract nouns, proper nouns, and entities\n        word_counts = Counter()\n        for token in doc:\n            if token.pos_ in [\"NOUN\", \"PROPN\"] and not token.is_stop and len(token.text) > 2:\n                word_counts[token.text] += 1\n        \n        # Extract multi-word entities (e.g., \"Elon Musk\")\n        entity_counts = Counter(ent.text.lower() for ent in doc.ents if len(ent.text.split()) > 1)\n        \n        # Combine and rank\n        combined_counts = word_counts + entity_counts\n        top_keywords = [word for word, count in combined_counts.most_common(top_n)]\n        \n        return top_keywords\n    keywords_nlp = extract_keywords_nlp(data)\n    keywords +=keywords_nlp\n    # Step 2: Extract Title\n    def get_title(phrase_counts, min_count=10):\n        # Filter out noise and low-frequency phrases\n        valid_phrases = {phrase: count for phrase, count in phrase_counts.items() \n                         if count > min_count and phrase and not phrase.startswith(\"~~~\") and len(phrase.split()) > 1}\n        try:\n            # Sort by frequency and pick the top phrase\n            top_phrase = max(valid_phrases.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]\n        except:\n            top_phrase=''"

It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 8 of 14\n\n        return top_phrase.capitalize()\n\n    title+= ' '+ get_title(phrase_counts)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file.

Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 10 of 14\n\n    description = get_description(phrase_counts)"

The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 13 of 14\n\n    return {\"description\":description,\"uploader\":uploader,\"title\":title,'keywords':keywords}\ndef extract_subtitles(text_contents, total_frames, frequency_threshold=0.2, min_subtitle_count=1, max_subtitle_count=10):"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 13\n\n    # Open the first image and convert to RGB if necessary\n    first_image = Image.open(image_paths[0])\n    if first_image.mode in (\"RGBA\", \"P\"):\n        first_image = first_image.convert(\"RGB\")\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#previously generated_title#\n\nPDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 13\n\n    # List to hold subsequent images\n    image_list = []\n    for img_path in image_paths[1:]:\n        img = Image.open(img_path)\n        if img.mode in (\"RGBA\", \"P\"):\n            img = img.convert(\"RGB\")\n        image_list.append(img)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields.

It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 6 of 13\n\n    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(main_pdf_path)\n    num_pages = len(pdf_reader.pages)\n    logging.info(f\"Processing {pdf_name} with {num_pages} pages\")"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis).

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 9 of 13\n\n                # Extract text directly from the image\n                text = convert_image_to_text(img_path)\n                txt_path = os.path.join(text_dir, basename_txt)\n                write_to_file(file_path=txt_path, contents=text)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 10 of 13\n\n                # Clean the extracted text\n                cleaned_text = clean_text(text)\n                cleaned_text_path = os.path.join(cleaned_text_dir, cleaned_basename_txt)\n                write_to_file(file_path=cleaned_text_path, contents=cleaned_text)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields.

It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 13 of 13\n\n                # Clean the preprocessed text\n                preprocessed_cleaned_text = clean_text(preprocessed_text)\n                \n                preprocessed_cleaned_txt_path = os.path.join(cleaned_preprocessed_text_dir, preprocessed_cleaned_basename_txt)\n                write_to_file(file_path=preprocessed_cleaned_txt_path, contents=preprocessed_cleaned_text)\n                    \n                logging.info(f\"Processed page {page_num + 1} of {pdf_name}\")\n"

It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description.

It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\".

It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment.

This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 8\n\ndef extract_audio_from_video_call(req=None,info_data=None):\n    keys = ['audio_path',\n            'video_path']\n    new_data = {}\n    for key in keys:\n        new_data[key] = info_data.get(key)\n        if not new_data[key]:\n            if key == 'audio_path':\n                new_data[key] = get_audio_path(**all_data)\n            elif key == 'video_path':\n                new_data[key] = all_data.get('video_path')\n    extract_audio_from_video(**new_data)\n    return info_data"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 4 of 8\n\ndef transcribe_with_wisper_call(req=None,info_data=None):\n    keys = ['audio_path',\n            'model_size',\n            'language',\n            'use_silence',\n            'info_data']\n    bool_key = 'whisper_result'\n    function = transcribe_with_whisper_local_data\n    info_data = execute_if_bool(bool_key,function,keys,req=req,info_data=info_data)\n    return info_data"

The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis).

The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description.

It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 5 of 8\n\n\ndef analyze_video_text_call(req=None,info_data=None):\n    keys = ['video_path',\n            'thumbnails_directory',\n            'info_data',\n            'remove_phrases',\n            'video_id']\n    bool_key = 'video_text'\n    function = analyze_video_text_data\n    info_data = execute_if_bool(bool_key,function,keys,req=req,info_data=info_data)\n    return info_data"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract.

A function 'get_summary_data' is called based on the boolean key value, consequently gathering summary data of the executed instructions, which might involve capturing the summary of the processed multimedia content.\\n\\nSimilarly, 'get_seo_data_call' works with a more extensive list of keys which include 'uploader', 'domain', 'categories', 'videos_url', 'repository_dir', 'directory_links', 'videos_dir', 'infos_dir', 'base_url', 'generator', 'LEDTokenizer', 'LEDForConditionalGeneration', and 'info_data'. The boolean key used here is 'seo_description', which triggers the function 'get_seo_data'. Given the inclusion of 'LEDTokenizer', 'LEDForConditionalGeneration' and various directory path configurations, it can be speculated that this function likely processes SEO related data for the component modules, possibly for generating SEO friendly descriptions or metadata.\\n\\nOverall, this script appears to contribute functionality towards the generation of summaries and SEO-friendly metadata for multimedia content processed by the 'abstract_ocr' package.\", 'generate_title': 'SEO_and_Summary_Generation_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Repo_Utils'}",

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 8 of 8\n\ndef get_all_info_data_call(video_path,info_dir=None):\n    info_data = get_initial_info_data(video_path=video_path,info_dir=info_dir)\n    info_data = extract_audio_from_video_call(info_data = info_data)\n    info_data = transcribe_with_wisper_call(info_data = info_data)\n    info_data = analyze_video_text_call(info_data = info_data)\n    info_data['full_text'] = info_data.get('whisper_result',{}).get('text')\n    info_data = refine_keywords_call(info_data = info_data)\n    info_data = get_summary_call(info_data = info_data)\n    info_data = get_seo_data_call(info_data = info_data)\n    return info_data\n"

For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 1\n\nfrom . import *\n"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 7\n\ndef chunk_summaries(chunks,\n                    max_length=None,\n                    min_length=None,\n                    truncation=False):"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 4 of 7\n\n    max_length = max_length or 160\n    min_length = min_length or 40\n    summaries = []\n    for idx, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n       \n            out = summarizer(\n                chunk,\n                max_length=max_length,\n                min_length=min_length,\n                truncation=truncation  # >>> explicitly drop over‑long parts if still above model limit\n            )\n            summaries.append(out[0][\"summary_text\"])\n   \n    return summaries"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 5 of 7\n\ndef split_to_chunk(full_text,max_words=None):\n    # split into sentence-ish bits\n    max_words = max_words or 300\n    sentences = full_text.split(\". \")\n    chunks, buf = [], \"\"\n    for sent in sentences:\n        # +1 for the “. ” we removed\n        if len((buf + sent).split()) <= max_words:\n            buf += sent + \". \"\n        else:\n            chunks.append(buf.strip())\n            buf = sent + \". \"\n    if buf:\n        chunks.append(buf.strip())\n    return chunks\ndef get_summary(full_text,\n                keywords=None,\n                max_words=None,\n                max_length=None,\n                min_length=None,\n                truncation=False):\n    summary =  None\n    if full_text and summarizer:\n        chunks = split_to_chunk(full_text,max_words=max_words)\n        summaries = chunk_summaries(chunks,\n                        max_length=max_length,\n                        min_length=min_length,\n                        truncation=truncation)\n        # stitch back together\n        summary = \" \".join(summaries).strip()\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#previously generated_title#\n\nText_Summarization_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR"

Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 6 of 7\n\n    return summary\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#previously generated_title#\n\nText_Chunking_and_Summarization_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\".

This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 4\n\nfrom .text_utils import *\nfrom .audio_utils import *\nfrom .seo_utils import *\nfrom .ocr_utils import *\nfrom .functions import *\nfrom .audio_utils import transcribe_audio_file_clean,transcribe_with_whisper_local\n# Clear root logger handlers to prevent duplicate console output\nlogging.getLogger('').handlers.clear()"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 4\n\n###json_data,chunk_length_ms=10000,renew=False\ndef transcribe_all_video_paths(directory=None,\n                               output_dir=None,\n                               remove_phrases=None,\n                               summarizer=None,\n                               kw_model=None,\n                               generator=None,\n                               LEDTokenizer=None,\n                               LEDForConditionalGeneration=None,\n                               uploader=None,\n                               domain=None,\n                               categories=None,\n                               videos_url=None,\n                               repository_dir=None,\n                               directory_links=None,\n                               videos_dir=None,\n                               infos_dir=None,\n                               base_url=None,\n                               chunk_length_ms=None,\n                               chunk_length_diff=None,\n                               title=None,\n                               renew=None,\n                               remove_text=None,\n                               video_id=None):\n    logger.info(f\"Entering transcribe_all_video_paths\")\n    directory = directory or os.getcwd()\n    paths = glob.glob(path_join(directory, '**', '**'), recursive=True)\n    paths = [file_path for file_path in paths if confirm_type(file_path,\n                                                              media_types=get_media_types(['video']))]\n    video_paths = get_all_file_types(directory=directory, types='video') or get_all_file_types(directory=directory, types='videos')\n    for video_path in video_paths:\n        transcribe_video_path(video_path=video_path,\n                              output_dir=output_dir,\n                              remove_phrases=remove_phrases,\n                              summarizer=summarizer,\n                              kw_model=kw_model,\n                              generator=generator,\n                              LEDTokenizer=LEDTokenizer,\n                              LEDForConditionalGeneration=LEDForConditionalGeneration,\n                              uploader=uploader,\n                              domain=domain,\n                              categories=categories,\n                              videos_url=videos_url,\n                              repository_dir=repository_dir,\n                              directory_links=directory_links,\n                              videos_dir=videos_dir,\n                              infos_dir=infos_dir,\n                              base_url=base_url,\n                              chunk_length_ms=chunk_length_ms,\n                              chunk_length_diff=chunk_length_diff,\n                              title = title,\n                              renew=renew,\n                              remove_text=remove_text,\n                              video_id=video_id)\n    logger.info(f\"Exiting transcribe_all_video_paths\")"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 4\n\ndef transcribe_video_path(video_path,\n                          output_dir=None,\n                          remove_phrases=None,\n                          summarizer=None,\n                          kw_model=None,\n                          generator=None,\n                          LEDTokenizer=None,\n                          LEDForConditionalGeneration=None,\n                          uploader=None,\n                          domain=None,\n                          categories=None,\n                          videos_url=None,\n                          repository_dir=None,\n                          directory_links=None,\n                          videos_dir=None,\n                          infos_dir=None,\n                          base_url=None,\n                          chunk_length_ms=None,\n                          chunk_length_diff=None,\n                          title=None,\n                          renew=None,\n                          remove_text=None,\n                          video_id=None):\n    remove_phrases = remove_phrases or []\n    output_dir = output_dir if output_dir else make_dirs(directory, 'text_dir')\n    logger.info(f\"Processing video: {video_path}\")\n    info = get_info_data(video_path,\n                         output_dir=output_dir,\n                         remove_phrases=remove_phrases,\n                         uploader=uploader,\n                         domain=domain,\n                         categories=categories,\n                         videos_url=videos_url,\n                         chunk_length_ms=chunk_length_ms,\n                         chunk_length_diff=chunk_length_diff,\n                         title=title,\n                         renew=renew,\n                         video_id=video_id)\n    \n    if not os.path.isfile(info['audio_path']):\n        extract_audio_from_video(video_path=info['video_path'],\n                                 audio_path=info['audio_path'])\n    if info.get(\"whisper_result\") == None:\n        info = transcribe_with_whisper_local(\n                                            json_data=info,\n                                            audio_path=info['audio_path'],\n                                            model_size= \"small\",           # one of \"tiny\", \"base\", \"small\", \"medium\", \"large\"\n                                            language='english')\n    if info.get('video_text') == None:                                      \n        info = analyze_video_text(video_path=info['video_path'],\n                           output_dir=info['thumbnails_directory'],\n                           json_data=info,\n                           remove_phrases=info['remove_phrases'],\n                           video_id=info['video_id'])\n    if info.get(\"combined_keywords\") == None:\n        info = get_text_and_keywords(info,\n                                     summarizer=summarizer,\n                                     kw_model=kw_model)\n    if info.get('seo_description') == None:\n        info = get_seo_data(info,\n                            uploader=uploader,\n                            domain=domain,\n                            categories=categories,\n                            videos_url=videos_url,\n                            repository_dir=repository_dir,\n                            directory_links=directory_links,\n                            videos_dir=videos_dir,\n                            infos_dir=infos_dir,\n                            base_url=base_url,\n                            generator=generator,\n                            LEDTokenizer=LEDTokenizer,\n                            LEDForConditionalGeneration=LEDForConditionalGeneration)\n    safe_dump_to_file(data=info,\n                      file_path=info['info_path'])\n    return info"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package.

Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 4 of 4\n\ndef get_info_data(video_path,\n                  output_dir=None,\n                  remove_phrases=None,\n                  uploader=None,\n                  domain=None,\n                  categories=None,\n                  videos_url=None,\n                  chunk_length_ms=None,\n                  chunk_length_diff=None,\n                  title=None,\n                  renew=None,\n                  remove_text=None,\n                  video_id=None):\n    remove_phrases = remove_phrases or []\n    remove_text = remove_text or False\n    basename = os.path.basename(video_path)\n    filename, ext = os.path.splitext(basename)\n    video_id = video_id or filename.replace(' ', '-').lower()\n    info_directory = make_dirs(output_dir, video_id)\n    thumbnails_directory = make_dirs(info_directory, 'thumbnails')\n    info_path = os.path.join(info_directory, 'info.json')\n    video_text_path = os.path.join(info_directory, 'video_text.json')\n    audio_path = os.path.join(info_directory, 'audio.wav')\n    video_json_path = os.path.join(info_directory, 'video_json.json')\n    categories = categories or {'ai': 'Technology', 'cannabis': 'Health', 'elon musk': 'Business'}\n    uploader = uploader or 'The Daily Dialectics'\n    domain = domain or 'https://thedailydialectics.com'\n    videos_url = videos_url or f\"{domain}/videos\"\n    canonical_url = f\"{videos_url}/{video_id}\"\n    chunk_length_ms = if_none_get_def(chunk_length_ms, 8000)\n    chunk_length_diff = if_none_get_def(chunk_length_diff, -5)\n    renew = if_none_get_def(renew, False)\n    info = {}\n    if os.path.isfile(info_path):\n        info = safe_read_from_json(info_path)\n    \n    info['parent_dir']=output_dir\n    info['video_path'] = video_path\n    info['info_directory'] = info_directory\n    info['thumbnails_directory']=thumbnails_directory\n    info['info_path'] = info_path\n    info['filename'] = video_id\n    info['ext'] = ext\n    info['title'] = title\n    info['remove_phrases'] = remove_phrases\n    info['audio_path'] = audio_path\n    info['video_json'] = video_json_path\n    info['categories'] = categories\n    info['uploader'] = uploader\n    info['domain'] = domain\n    info['videos_url'] = videos_url\n    info['video_id'] = video_id\n    info['canonical_url'] = canonical_url\n    info['chunk_length_ms'] = chunk_length_ms\n    info['chunk_length_diff'] = chunk_length_diff\n    info['renew'] = renew\n    safe_dump_to_file(data=info, file_path=info['info_path'])\n    return info"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes.

This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 1\n\nfrom .functions import *\n"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 2\n\nfrom .functions import (VideoFileClip,\n                        cv2,\n                        os,\n                        np,\n                        math,\n                        mp,\n                        logger,\n                        generate_file_id,\n                        get_all_file_types,\n                        sort_frames)\nfrom .ocr_utils import extract_image_texts_from_directory\ndef clip_frames(items,initial=None,end=None):\n    initial = initial or 35\n    end = end or 35\n    items_length = len(items)\n    if items_length> initial:\n        items = items[initial:]\n    items_length = len(items)\n    if items_length> end:\n        items = items[:-end]\n    return items\ndef pick_optimal_thumbnail(whisper_result, keywords,directory, *args,initial=None,end=None,**kwargs):\n    scores = []\n    keywords = keywords or []\n    dirbase = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(directory))\n    image_files = sort_frames(directory=directory)\n    image_files = clip_frames(image_files)\n    first_image_file = image_files[0]\n    thumb_name,thumb_ext = os.path.splitext(os.listdir(directory)[0])\n    # Process each Whisper segment\n    for segment in whisper_result[\"segments\"]:\n        text = segment[\"text\"].lower().strip()\n        start_time = segment[\"start\"]        # Find the closest thumbnail based on start time\n        frame_number = math.floor(start_time)\n        thumbnail_name = f\"{dirbase}_frame_{frame_number}{thumb_ext}\"\n        \n        # Check if thumbnail exists\n        if thumbnail_name not in image_files:\n            continue\n        \n        # Score the caption\n        keyword_score = sum(1 for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in text)\n        clarity_score = 1 if len(text) > 20 else 0\n        end_phrase_penalty = -1 if \"thanks for watching\" in text else 0\n        total_score = keyword_score + clarity_score + end_phrase_penalty\n        \n        # Store thumbnail path, score, and caption\n        thumbnail_path = os.path.join(directory, thumbnail_name)\n        scores.append((thumbnail_path, total_score, text))\n       \n    # Sort by score (highest first)\n    scores = sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    return scores[0] if scores else None\ndef pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim(video_text,\n                           combined_keywords):\n    scores = []\n    for entry in video_text:\n        \n        text = entry['text'].lower()\n        \n        keyword_score = sum(1 for kw in combined_keywords if kw.lower() in text)\n        \n        clarity_score = 1 if len(text.strip()) > 20 else 0  # basic clarity check\n        \n        end_phrase_penalty = -1 if \"thanks for watching\" in text else 0\n        \n        total_score = keyword_score + clarity_score + end_phrase_penalty\n        \n        scores.append((entry['frame'],\n                       total_score,\n                       text.strip()))\n    scores = sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    return scores[0] if scores else None\ndef extract_video_frames(video_path,directory,video_id=None,frame_interval=None):\n    frame_interval = frame_interval or 1\n    video = VideoFileClip(video_path)\n    duration = video.duration\n    video_id = video_id or generate_file_id(video_path)\n    for t in range(0, int(duration), frame_interval):\n        frame_path = os.path.join(directory,f\"{video_id}_frame_{t}.jpg\")\n        if not os.path.isfile(frame_path):\n            frame = video.get_frame(t)\n            cv2.imwrite(frame_path, cv2.cvtColor(np.array(frame), cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR))\ndef analyze_video_text(video_path,\n                       directory=None,\n                       image_texts=None,\n                       remove_phrases=None,\n                       video_id=None,\n                       frame_interval=None):\n    if video_path == None or not video_path or not os.path.isfile(video_path):\n        return image_texts\n    remove_phrases=remove_phrases or []\n    output_directory = directory or os.getcwd()\n    \n    extract_video_frames(video_path=video_path,\n                          directory=directory,\n                          frame_interval=frame_interval)\n    image_texts = extract_image_texts_from_directory(directory=directory,\n                                                     image_texts=image_texts,\n                                                     remove_phrases=remove_phrases)\n    \n    return image_texts"

'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1.

Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 2\n\ndef get_video_metadata(file_path):\n    video = mp.VideoFileClip(file_path)\n    \n    metadata = {\n        'resolution': f\"{video.w}x{video.h}\",\n        'format': 'MP4',\n        'file_size_mb': os.path.getsize(file_path) / (1024 * 1024)\n    }\n    \n    video.close()\n    return metadata\ndef extract_audio_from_video(video_path, audio_path=None):\n    \"\"\"Extract audio from a video file using moviepy.\"\"\"\n    if audio_path == None:\n        video_directory = os.path.dirname(video_path)\n        audio_path = video_directory\n    if os.path.isdir(audio_path):\n        audio_path = os.path.join(audio_path,'audio.wav')\n    try:\n        logger.info(f\"Extracting audio from {video_path} to {audio_path}\")\n        video = mp.VideoFileClip(video_path)\n        video.audio.write_audiofile(audio_path)\n        video.close()\n        if not os.path.exists(audio_path):\n            raise FileNotFoundError(f\"Audio file {audio_path} was not created.\")\n        logger.info(f\"Audio extracted successfully: {audio_path}\")\n        return audio_path\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error extracting audio from {video_path}: {e}\")\n        return None\n"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 1\n\nfrom .audio_utils import *\nfrom .functions import *\nfrom .ocr_utils import *\nfrom .pdf_utils import *\nfrom .seo_utils import *\nfrom .text_utils import *\nfrom .transcribe_utils import *\nfrom .audio_utils_clean import *\n"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 13\n\nfrom .functions import (os,\n                        logger,\n                        whisper,\n                        AudioSegment,\n                        sr,\n                        detect_nonsilent,\n                        format_timestamp,\n                        safe_dump_to_file,\n                        List,\n                        shutil,\n                        _format_srt_timestamp)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 13\n\nSAMPLE_RATE = whisper.audio.SAMPLE_RATE  # 16000 Hz\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#previously generated_title#\n\nImporting_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 13\n\ndef get_audio_duration(file_path):\n    audio = AudioSegment.from_wav(file_path)\n    duration_seconds = len(audio) / 1000\n    duration_formatted = format_timestamp(len(audio))\n    return duration_seconds,duration_formatted\ndef transcribe_audio_file_clean(\n    audio_path: str,\n    json_data: str = None,\n    min_silence_len: int = 500,\n    silence_thresh_delta: int = 16\n    ):\n    \"\"\"\n    Load `audio_path`, detect all non-silent ranges, transcribe each,\n    and (optionally) dump to JSON at `output_json`.\n    \"\"\"\n    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()\n    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_path)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#previously generated_title#\n\nSetting_Audio_Sample_Rate_in_Abstract_OCR"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 4 of 13\n\n    # 1) Calibrate once on the first second\n    calib = audio[:1000]\n    calib_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(audio_path), \"_calib.wav\")\n    calib.export(calib_path, format=\"wav\")\n    with sr.AudioFile(calib_path) as src:\n        recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(src, duration=1)\n    os.remove(calib_path)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 5 of 13\n\n    # 2) Compute dynamic silence threshold, then find real speech segments\n    silence_thresh = audio.dBFS - silence_thresh_delta\n    nonsilent = detect_nonsilent(\n        audio,\n        min_silence_len=min_silence_len,\n        silence_thresh=silence_thresh\n    )\n    \n    json_data[\"audio_text\"] = []\n    for idx, (start_ms, end_ms) in enumerate(nonsilent):\n        logger.info(f\"Transcribing segment {idx}: {start_ms}-{end_ms} ms\")\n        chunk = audio[start_ms:end_ms]"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 6 of 13\n\n        chunk_path = f\"_chunk_{idx}.wav\"\n        chunk.export(chunk_path, format=\"wav\")"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 7 of 13\n\n        with sr.AudioFile(chunk_path) as src:\n            audio_data = recognizer.record(src)\n        try:\n            text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)\n        except sr.UnknownValueError:\n            text = \"\""

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 9 of 13\n\n    # 3) Optionally write out the JSON"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 10 of 13\n\n        full_text = [ entry[\"text\"] \n                for entry in json_data.get(\"audio_text\", []) \n                if entry.get(\"text\") ]\n        full_text = \" \".join(full_text).strip()\n        json_data[\"full_text\"] = full_text\n        safe_dump_to_file(json_data, json_data['info_path'])\n    \n    return json_data"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 11 of 13\n\ndef chunk_fixed(\n    audio_array: np.ndarray,\n    sr: int = SAMPLE_RATE,\n    chunk_length_s: int = 30,\n    overlap_s: int = 5\n) -> List[np.ndarray]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Split a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\n    \"\"\"\n    chunk_len = chunk_length_s * sr\n    overlap  = overlap_s  * sr\n    step     = chunk_len - overlap\n    total    = audio_array.shape[0]\n    chunks: List[np.ndarray] = []\n    for start in range(0, total, step):\n        end = min(start + chunk_len, total)\n        chunks.append(audio_array[start:end])\n        if end == total:\n            break\n    return chunks"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 12 of 13\n\ndef chunk_on_silence(\n    audio_path: str,\n    min_silence_len: int = 700,\n    silence_thresh: Optional[int] = None,\n    keep_silence: int = 300\n) -> List[AudioSegment]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Load the file and split on silent parts.\n    Returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks.\n    \"\"\"\n    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(audio_path)\n    # dynamically set threshold ~16 dB below average loudness\n    silence_thresh = silence_thresh or int(audio.dBFS) - 16\n    return split_on_silence(\n        audio,\n        min_silence_len=min_silence_len,\n        silence_thresh=silence_thresh,\n        keep_silence=keep_silence\n    )"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 10\n\nimport (spacy,\n        pytesseract,\n        cv2,\n        PyPDF2,\n        argparse,\n        whisper,\n        shutil,\n        os,\n        sys,\n        json,\n        logging,\n        glob,\n        hashlib)\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom  datetime import timedelta \nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom pdf2image import convert_from_path\nimport speech_recognition as sr\nfrom pydub.silence import detect_nonsilent\nfrom pydub.silence import split_on_silence\nfrom pydub import AudioSegment\nfrom abstract_math import (divide_it,\n                           multiply_it)\nfrom typing import *\nfrom urllib.parse import quote\nfrom abstract_utilities import (timestamp_to_milliseconds,\n                                format_timestamp,\n                                get_time_now_iso,\n                                parse_timestamp,\n                                get_logFile,\n                                url_join,\n                                make_dirs,\n                                safe_dump_to_file,\n                                safe_read_from_json,\n                                read_from_file,\n                                write_to_file,\n                                path_join,\n                                confirm_type,\n                                get_media_types,\n                                get_all_file_types,\n                                eatInner,\n                                eatOuter,\n                                eatAll)\n                                \nfrom keybert import KeyBERT\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport torch,os,json,unicodedata,hashlib\nfrom transformers import LEDTokenizer,LEDForConditionalGeneration"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 10\n\nsummarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\", model=\"Falconsai/text_summarization\")\nkeyword_extractor = pipeline(\"feature-extraction\", model=\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\ngenerator = pipeline('text-generation', model='distilgpt2', device= -1)\nkw_model = KeyBERT(model=keyword_extractor.model)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 10\n\n                                \nlogger = get_logFile('vid_to_aud')\nlogger.debug(f\"Logger initialized with {len(logger.handlers)} handlers: {[h.__class__.__name__ for h in logger.handlers]}\")"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 4 of 10\n\ndef create_key_value(json_obj, key, value):\n    json_obj[key] = json_obj.get(key, value) or value\n    return json_obj"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 5 of 10\n\ndef getPercent(i):\n    return divide_it(i, 100)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 6 of 10\n\ndef getPercentage(num, i):\n    percent = getPercent(i)\n    percentage = multiply_it(num, percent)\n    return percentage"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 7 of 10\n\ndef if_none_get_def(value, default):\n    if value is None:\n        value = default\n    return value"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 8 of 10\n\ndef if_not_dir_return_None(directory):\n    str_directory = str(directory)\n    if os.path.isdir(str_directory):\n        return str_directory\n    return None"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 9 of 10\n\ndef determine_remove_text(text,remove_phrases=None):\n    remove_phrases=remove_phrases or []\n    found = False\n    for remove_phrase in remove_phrases:\n        if remove_phrase in text:\n            found = True\n            break\n    if found == False:\n        return text"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 10 of 10\n\ndef generate_file_id(path: str, max_length: int = 50) -> str:\n    base = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(path))[0]\n    base = unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', base).encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode('ascii')\n    base = base.lower()\n    base = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9]+', '-', base).strip('-')\n    base = re.sub(r'-{2,}', '-', base)\n    if len(base) > max_length:\n        h = hashlib.sha1(base.encode()).hexdigest()[:8]\n        base = base[: max_length - len(h) - 1].rstrip('-') + '-' + h\n    return base\ndef clean_text(text: str) -> str:\n    text = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text)\n    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s:.,-]', '', text)\n    text = text.strip()\n    return text\ndef get_frame_number(file_path):\n    file_path = '.'.join(file_path.split('.')[:-1])\n    return int(file_path.split('_')[-1])\ndef sort_frames(frames=None,directory=None):\n    if frames in [None,[]] and directory and os.path.isdir(directory):\n        frames = get_all_file_types(types=['image'],directory=directory)\n    frames = frames or []\n    frames = sorted(\n        frames,\n        key=lambda x: get_frame_number(x) \n    )\n    return frames\n    \ndef get_from_list(list_obj=None,length=1):\n    list_obj = list_obj or []\n    if len(list_obj) >= length:\n        list_obj = list_obj[:length]\n    return list_obj\ndef get_image_metadata(file_path):\n    \"\"\"Extract image metadata (dimensions, file size).\"\"\"\n    try:\n        with Image.open(file_path) as img:\n            width, height = img.size\n            file_size = get_file_size(file_path)\n        return {\n            \"dimensions\": {\"width\": width, \"height\": height},\n            \"file_size\": round(file_size, 3)\n        }\n    except Exception as e:\n        return {\"dimensions\": {\"width\": 0, \"height\": 0}, \"file_size\": 0}\ndef update_sitemap(video_data,\n                   sitemap_path):\n    with open(sitemap_path, 'a') as f:\n        f.write(f\"\"\"\n<url>\n    <loc>{video_data['canonical_url']}</loc>\n    <video:video>\n        <video:title>{video_data['seo_title']}</video:title>\n        <video:description>{video_data['seo_description']}</video:description>\n        <video:thumbnail_loc>{video_data['thumbnail']['file_path']}</video:thumbnail_loc>\n        <video:content_loc>{video_data['video_path']}</video:content_loc>\n    </video:video>\n</url>\n\"\"\")\nEXT_TO_PREFIX = {\n    **dict.fromkeys(\n        {'.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.bmp', '.tiff', '.webp', '.svg'},\n        'infos'\n    ),\n    **dict.fromkeys(\n        {'.mp4', '.avi', '.mov', '.wmv', '.flv', '.mkv', '.webm'},\n        'videos'\n    ),\n    '.pdf': 'pdfs',\n    **dict.fromkeys({'.mp3', '.wav', '.ogg', '.flac', '.aac', '.m4a'}, 'audios'),\n    **dict.fromkeys({'.doc', '.docx', '.txt', '.rtf'}, 'docs'),\n    **dict.fromkeys({'.ppt', '.pptx'}, 'slides'),\n    **dict.fromkeys({'.xls', '.xlsx', '.csv'}, 'sheets'),\n    **dict.fromkeys({'.srt'}, 'srts'),\n}\n"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 8\n\nfrom .functions import (clean_text,\n                        re,\n                        write_to_file,\n                        cv2,np,\n                        pytesseract,\n                        Image,\n                        sort_frames)\ndef preprocess_for_ocr(image_path: str) -> np.ndarray:\n    img = cv2.imread(image_path)\n    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 8\n\n    # Enhance contrast\n    clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8, 8))\n    contrast = clahe.apply(gray)"

The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 8\n\n    # Denoise\n    denoised = cv2.bilateralFilter(contrast, d=9, sigmaColor=75, sigmaSpace=75)"

There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 4 of 8\n\n    # Thresholding\n    thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(\n        denoised,\n        255,\n        cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C,\n        cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV,\n        blockSize=11,\n        C=2\n    )\n    # Sharpen\n    kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)\n    morph = cv2.dilate(thresh, kernel, iterations=1)    \n    sharpen_kernel = np.array([[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 9, -1], [-1, -1, -1]])\n    sharpened = cv2.filter2D(thresh, -1, sharpen_kernel)"

It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 5 of 8\n\n    return sharpened\ndef extract_text_from_image(image_path: str) -> str:\n    try:\n        processed_img = preprocess_for_ocr(image_path)\n        pil_img = Image.fromarray(cv2.bitwise_not(processed_img))  # invert for OCR\n        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(pil_img, lang='eng')\n        return text\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"[OCR Error] {e}\")\n        return \"\"\ndef is_frame_analyzed(frame_file,video_text_data):\n    for values in video_text_data:\n        frame = values\n        if isinstance(values,dict):\n            frame = values.get(\"frame\")\n        if frame_file == frame:\n            return True\ndef extract_image_text(image_path,remove_phrases=None):\n    remove_phrases = remove_phrases or []\n    if confirm_type(image_path,media_types=['image']):\n        raw_text = extract_text_from_image(image_path)\n        cleaned_text = clean_text(raw_text)\n        text = determine_remove_text(cleaned_text,remove_phrases=info_data['remove_phrases'])\n        return text\ndef extract_text_from_frame(image_path,):\n    basename = os.pth.basename(image_path,image_texts)\n    if not is_frame_analyzed(basename,video_text):\n        text = extract_image_text(image_path,remove_phrases)\n        return {\"frame\": basename, \"text\": text}\ndef extract_image_texts_from_directory(directory,image_texts=None,remove_phrases=None):\n    image_texts = image_texts or []\n    image_files = get_all_file_types(types=['image'],directory=directory)\n    for i,image_path in enumerate(image_files):\n        extracted_text = extract_text_from_frame(image_path,image_texts)\n        if extracted_text:\n            image_texts.append(extracted_text)\n    image_texts = sort_frames(image_texts)\n    return image_texts"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 6 of 8\n\ndef download_pdf(url: str, output_path: str):\n    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        with open(output_path, \"wb\") as file:\n            for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):\n                file.write(chunk)\n        print(f\"PDF downloaded successfully: {output_path}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Failed to download PDF.

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 7 of 8\n\ndef convert_image_to_text(image_path: str,preprocess=True) -> str:\n    try:\n        if preprocess:\n            img = preprocess_for_ocr(image_path: str)\n        else:\n            img = Image.open(image_path)\n        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, lang='eng')\n        return text\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"OCR Error: {e}\")\n        return \"\""

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 8 of 8\n\n\n"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 13\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom .functions import (argparse,\n                        Image,\n                        os,\n                        PyPDF2,\n                        clean_text,\n                        write_to_file)\nfrom .ocr_utils import (preprocess_image,\n                        convert_image_to_text)\ndef images_to_pdf(image_paths, output_pdf):\n    if not image_paths:\n        raise ValueError(\"No image files provided for conversion.\")"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 13\n\n    # Open the first image and convert to RGB if necessary\n    first_image = Image.open(image_paths[0])\n    if first_image.mode in (\"RGBA\", \"P\"):\n        first_image = first_image.convert(\"RGB\")"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 13\n\n    # List to hold subsequent images\n    image_list = []\n    for img_path in image_paths[1:]:\n        img = Image.open(img_path)\n        if img.mode in (\"RGBA\", \"P\"):\n            img = img.convert(\"RGB\")\n        image_list.append(img)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#previously generated_title#\n\nRGB_Conversion_of_Images_in_Abstract_OCR"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 4 of 13\n\n    # Save all images into a single PDF file\n    first_image.save(output_pdf, \"PDF\", resolution=100.0, save_all=True, append_images=image_list)\n    print(f\"PDF saved as: {output_pdf}\")\ndef process_pdf(main_pdf_path: str, pdf_output_dir: str) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Process a PDF into pages, images, text, preprocessed images, preprocessed text, and cleaned preprocessed text.\"\"\"\n    # Get PDF filename without extension\n    pdf_name = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(main_pdf_path))[0]"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 5 of 13\n\n    # Create subdirectories for this PDF\n    pdf_pages_dir = os.path.join(pdf_output_dir, 'pdf_pages')\n    os.makedirs(pdf_pages_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    images_dir = os.path.join(pdf_output_dir, 'images')\n    os.makedirs(images_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    text_dir = os.path.join(pdf_output_dir, 'text')\n    os.makedirs(text_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    cleaned_text_dir = os.path.join(text_dir, 'cleaned')\n    os.makedirs(cleaned_text_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    preprocessed_images_dir = os.path.join(pdf_output_dir, 'preprocessed_images')\n    os.makedirs(preprocessed_images_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    preprocessed_text_dir = os.path.join(pdf_output_dir, 'preprocessed_text')\n    os.makedirs(preprocessed_text_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    cleaned_preprocessed_text_dir = os.path.join(preprocessed_text_dir, 'cleaned')\n    os.makedirs(cleaned_preprocessed_text_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#previously generated_title#\n\nProcessing_PDF_Pages_Images_and_Text_in_Abstract_OCR"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 6 of 13\n\n    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(main_pdf_path)\n    num_pages = len(pdf_reader.pages)\n    logging.info(f\"Processing {pdf_name} with {num_pages} pages\")\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#previously generated_title#\n\nSetting_Up_PDF_Processing_Structures_in_Abstract_OCR"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 7 of 13\n\n    for page_num in range(num_pages):\n        \n            # Split PDF into individual pages\n            pdf_writer = PyPDF2.PdfWriter()\n            pdf_writer.add_page(pdf_reader.pages[page_num])\n            filename = f\"{pdf_name}_page_{page_num + 1}\"\n            basename_pdf= f\"{filename}.pdf\"\n            basename_png= f\"{filename}.png\"\n            preprocessed_basename_png = f\"preprocessed_{basename_png}\"\n            basename_txt= f\"{filename}.txt\"\n            cleaned_basename_txt = f\"cleaned_{basename_txt}\"\n            preprocessed_basename_txt = f\"preprocessed_{basename_txt}\"\n            preprocessed_cleaned_basename_txt = f\"preprocessed_cleaned_{basename_txt}\"\n            page_path = os.path.join(pdf_pages_dir, basename_pdf)\n            with open(page_path, 'wb') as f:\n                pdf_writer.write(f)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 8 of 13\n\n            # Convert PDF page to image\n            images = convert_from_path(page_path)\n            if images:\n                # Save the image\n                img_path = os.path.join(images_dir, basename_png)\n                images[0].save(img_path, 'PNG')"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 9 of 13\n\n                # Extract text directly from the image\n                text = convert_image_to_text(img_path)\n                txt_path = os.path.join(text_dir, basename_txt)\n                write_to_file(file_path=txt_path, contents=text)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 10 of 13\n\n                # Clean the extracted text\n                cleaned_text = clean_text(text)\n                cleaned_text_path = os.path.join(cleaned_text_dir, cleaned_basename_txt)\n                write_to_file(file_path=cleaned_text_path, contents=cleaned_text)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 11 of 13\n\n                # Preprocess the image\n                \n                preprocessed_img_path = os.path.join(preprocessed_images_dir, preprocessed_basename_png)\n                preprocess_image(img_path, preprocessed_img_path)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 12 of 13\n\n                # Extract text from the preprocessed image\n                preprocessed_text = convert_image_to_text(preprocessed_img_path)\n                \n                preprocessed_txt_path = os.path.join(preprocessed_text_dir, preprocessed_basename_txt)\n                write_to_file(file_path=preprocessed_txt_path, contents=preprocessed_text)"

The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 13 of 13\n\n                # Clean the preprocessed text\n                preprocessed_cleaned_text = clean_text(preprocessed_text)\n                \n                preprocessed_cleaned_txt_path = os.path.join(cleaned_preprocessed_text_dir, preprocessed_cleaned_basename_txt)\n                write_to_file(file_path=preprocessed_cleaned_txt_path, contents=preprocessed_cleaned_text)\n                    \n                logging.info(f\"Processed page {page_num + 1} of {pdf_name}\")\n"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 5\n\nfrom .text_utils import *\nfrom .audio_utils import *\nfrom .video_utils import *"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 5\n\nfrom .functions import (logger,\n                        create_key_value,\n                        os,\n                        timestamp_to_milliseconds,\n                        format_timestamp,\n                        get_time_now_iso,\n                        parse_timestamp,\n                        url_join,\n                        get_from_list,\n                        quote,\n                        datetime)"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 5\n\ndef generate_info_json(filepath=None,\n                        prompt=None,\n                        alt_text=None,\n                        title=None,\n                        description=None,\n                        keywords=None,\n                        domain=None,\n                        video_path=None,\n                        repository_dir=None,\n                        generator=None,\n                        LEDTokenizer=None,\n                        LEDForConditionalGeneration=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Build structured info.json for an image, including SEO schema and social metadata.\n    \"\"\"\n    dirname = os.path.dirname(filepath)\n    basename = os.path.basename(filepath)\n    filename,ext = os.path.splitext(basename)\n    url_path = filepath\n    title_prompt = generate_with_bigbird(f\"Video of {filename.replace('-', ' ')} with the video text f{alt_text}\", task=\"title\")\n    description_prompt = generate_with_bigbird(f\"Video of {filename.replace('-', ' ')} with the video text f{alt_text}\", task=\"description\")\n    caption_prompt = generate_with_bigbird(f\"Video of {filename.replace('-', ' ')} with the video text f{alt_text}\", task=\"caption\")\n    img_meta = get_image_metadata(str(filepath)) if os.path.isfile(filepath) else {\"dimensions\": {\"width\": 0, \"height\": 0}, \"file_size\": 0.0}\n    dimensions = img_meta.get(\"dimensions\",{})\n    width = dimensions.get('width')\n    height = dimensions.get('height')\n    file_size = img_meta.get(\"file_size\")\n    description = alt_text\n    title = filename\n    caption = alt_text\n    if generator:\n        gen = generator(prompt, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)[0]\n        description = gen.get('generated_text', '')[:150]\n    description = alt_text\n    title = title or filename\n    caption = caption or alt_text\n    info = {\n        \"alt\": alt_text,\n        \"caption\": alt_text,\n        \"keywords_str\": keywords,\n        \"filename\": filename,\n        \"ext\": f\"{ext}\",\n        \"title\": f\"{title} ({width}×{height})\",\n        \"dimensions\": dimensions,\n        \"file_size\": file_size,\n        \"license\": \"CC BY-SA 4.0\",\n        \"attribution\": \"Created by thedailydialectics for educational purposes\",\n        \"longdesc\": description,\n        \"schema\": {\n            \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"name\": filename,\n            \"description\": description,\n            \"url\": generate_media_url(filepath,domain=domain,repository_dir=repository_dir),\n            \"contentUrl\": generate_media_url(video_path,domain=domain,repository_dir=repository_dir),\n            \"width\": width,\n            \"height\": height,\n            \"license\": \"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\",\n            \"creator\": {\"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"thedailydialectics\"},\n            \"datePublished\": datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n        },\n        \"social_meta\": {\n            \"og:image\": generate_media_url(filepath,domain=domain,repository_dir=repository_dir),\n            \"og:image:alt\": alt_text,\n            \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n            \"twitter:image\": generate_media_url(filepath,domain=domain,repository_dir=repository_dir)\n        }\n    }\n    return info\ndef get_seo_title(title,keywords,title_length=None):\n    title_length =title_length or 70\n    primary_keyword = keywords[0] if keywords and len(keywords)>0 else filename\n    seo_title = f\"{primary_keyword} -

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 4 of 5\n\n    info = create_key_value(info,\n                            'categories',\n                            categories or {'ai': 'Technology', 'cannabis': 'Health', 'elon musk': 'Business'})\n    \n    info = create_key_value(info,\n                            'uploader',\n                            uploader or 'The Daily Dialectics')\n    \n    info = create_key_value(info,\n                            'domain',\n                            domain or 'https://thedailydialectics.com')\n    \n    info = create_key_value(info,\n                            'videos_url',\n                            videos_url or f\"{info['domain']}/videos\")\n    video_path = info.get('video_path')\n    for keyword_key in ['combined_keywords','keywords']:\n        keywords = info.get(keyword_key,[])\n        if keywords and len(keywords)>0:\n            break\n    filename = info.get('filename')\n    if not filename:\n        basename = os.path.basename(video_path)\n        filename,ext = os.path.splitext(basename)\n        info['basename'] = basename\n        info['filename'] = filename\n    info['title'] = info.get('title',filename)\n    summary = info.get('summary','')\n    primary_keyword,seo_title,keywords_str,seo_description,seo_tags = get_title_tags_description(title,keywords,summary)\n    info['seo_title'] = seo_title\n    info['seo_description'] = seo_description\n    info['seo_tags'] = seo_tags\n    video_text = info.get('video_text')\n    info['thumbnail']={}\n    if video_text and len(video_text)>0:\n        thumnail_data = video_text[0]\n        thumbnail_filepath = os.path.join(info['thumbnails_directory'],thumnail_data.get(\"frame\"))\n        info['thumbnail']['file_path'] = thumbnail_filepath\n        \n        thumbnail_alt_text = thumnail_data.get(\"text\")\n        info['thumbnail']['alt_text']= thumbnail_alt_text\n        \n    whisper_json = info[\"whisper_result\"]\n    thumbnail_score = pick_optimal_thumbnail(whisper_json,keywords,info[\"thumbnails_directory\"])\n    if thumbnail_score:\n        best_frame, score, matched_text = thumbnail_score\n        file_path = os.path.join(info['thumbnails_directory'],best_frame)\n        info['thumbnail']['file_path']= file_path\n        \n        alt_text = get_from_list(matched_text,length=100)\n        info['thumbnail']['alt_text']= alt_text\n        \n        basename = os.path.basename(file_path)\n        filename,ext = os.path.splitext(basename)\n        \n        prompt = f\"Generate SEO metadata for {filename} with the video text f{alt_text}\"\n        thumbnail_seo_data = generate_info_json(file_path,\n                                                prompt,\n                                                alt_text,\n                                                seo_title,\n                                                seo_description,\n                                                keywords,\n                                                domain,\n                                                video_path,\n                                                repository_dir,\n                                                generator,\n                                                LEDTokenizer,\n                                                LEDForConditionalGeneration)\n        info['thumbnail']['seo_data']= thumbnail_seo_data\n    "

Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 5 of 5\n\n    \n    duration_seconds,duration_formatted = get_audio_duration(info['audio_path'])\n    info['duration_seconds'] = duration_second\n    info['duration_formatted'] = duration_formatted\n    export_srt_whisper(\n        whisper_json,\n        os.path.join(info[\"info_directory\"], \"captions.srt\")\n    )\n    \n    info['captions_path'] = os.path.join(info['info_directory'],\n                                         \"captions.srt\")\n    \n    info['schema_markup'] = {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\n        \"name\": info['seo_title'],\n        \"description\": info['seo_description'],\n        \"thumbnailUrl\": info['thumbnail']['file_path'],\n        \"duration\": f\"PT{int(info['duration_seconds'] // 60)}M{int(info['duration_seconds'] % 60)}S\",\n        \"uploadDate\": get_time_now_iso(),\n        \"contentUrl\": info['video_path'],\n        \"keywords\": info['seo_tags']\n    }\n    \n    info['social_metadata'] = {\n        \"og:title\": info['seo_title'],\n        \"og:description\": info['seo_description'],\n        \"og:image\": info['thumbnail']['file_path'],\n        \"og:video\": info['video_path'],\n        \"twitter:card\": \"player\",\n        \"twitter:title\": info['seo_title'],\n        \"twitter:description\": info['seo_description'],\n        \"twitter:image\": info['thumbnail']['file_path']\n    }\n    \n    info['category'] = next((v for k, v in info['categories'].items() if k in ' '.join(info['seo_tags']).lower()), 'General')\n    \n    info['uploader'] = {\"name\": info['uploader'],\n                        \"url\": info['domain']}\n    \n    info['publication_date'] = get_time_now_iso()\n    \n    info['video_metadata'] = get_video_metadata(file_path)\n    \n    update_sitemap(info,\n                   f\"{info['parent_dir']}/../sitemap.xml\")\n    \n    return info\n"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 7\n\nfrom .functions import (extract_text_from_image,\n                        logger,\n                        Counter,\n                        spacy,\n                        kw_model,\n                        summarizer,\n                        LEDTokenizer,\n                        LEDForConditionalGeneration)\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\ndef generate_with_bigbird(text: str, task: str = \"title\", model_dir: str = \"allenai/led-base-16384\") -> str:\n    try:\n        tokenizer = LEDTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_dir)\n        model = LEDForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_dir)\n        prompt = (\n            f\"Generate a concise, SEO-optimized {task} for the following content: {text[:1000]}\"\n            if task in [\"title\", \"caption\", \"description\"]\n            else f\"Summarize the following content into a 100-150 word SEO-optimized abstract: {text[:4000]}\"\n        )\n        inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\", max_length=512, truncation=True)\n        outputs = model.generate(\n            inputs[\"input_ids\"],\n            max_length=200 if task in [\"title\", \"caption\"] else 300,\n            num_beams=5,\n            early_stopping=True\n        )\n        return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error in BigBird processing: {e}\")\n        return \"\"\ndef generate_media_url(fs_path: str,domain=None,repository_dir=None) -> str | None:\n    fs_path = os.path.abspath(fs_path)\n    if not fs_path.startswith(repository_dir):\n        return None\n    rel_path = fs_path[len(repository_dir):]\n    rel_path = quote(rel_path.replace(os.sep, '/'))\n    ext = os.path.splitext(fs_path)[1].lower()\n    prefix = EXT_TO_PREFIX.get(ext, 'repository')\n    return f\"{domain}/{prefix}/{rel_path}\"\ndef get_keybert(full_text,\n                keyphrase_ngram_range=None,\n                top_n=None,\n                stop_words=None,\n                use_mmr=None,\n                diversity=None):\n    keyphrase_ngram_range = keyphrase_ngram_range or (1,3),\n    top_n = top_n or 10,\n    stop_words = stop_words or \"english\",\n    use_mmr = use_mmr or True,\n    diversity = diversity or 0.5\n    keybert = kw_model.extract_keywords(\n        full_text,\n        keyphrase_ngram_range=keyphrase_ngram_range,\n        stop_words=stop_words,\n        top_n=top_n,\n        use_mmr=use_mmr,\n        diversity=diversity\n    )\n    return keybert\ndef extract_keywords_nlp(text, top_n=10):\n    if not isinstance(text,str):\n        logger.info(f\"this is not a string: {text}\")\n    doc = nlp(str(text))\n    word_counts = Counter(token.text for token in doc if token.pos_ in [\"NOUN\", \"PROPN\"] and not token.is_stop and len(token.text) > 2)\n    entity_counts = Counter(ent.text.lower() for ent in doc.ents if len(ent.text.split()) > 1)\n    top_keywords = [word for word, _ in (word_counts + entity_counts).most_common(top_n)]\n    return top_keywords"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 7\n\ndef refine_keywords(keywords,\n                    full_text,\n                     keyphrase_ngram_range=None,\n                     top_n=None,\n                     stop_words=None,\n                     use_mmr=None,\n                     diversity=None,\n                    info_data={}):\n    info_data['keywords'] =  keywords or extract_keywords_nlp(full_text, top_n=top_n)\n    keybert = get_keybert(full_text,\n                keyphrase_ngram_range=keyphrase_ngram_range,\n                top_n=top_n,\n                stop_words=stop_words,\n                use_mmr=use_mmr,\n                diversity=diversity)\n    info_data['combined_keywords'] = list({kw for kw,_ in keybert} | set(info_data['keywords']))[:10]\n    info_data['keyword_density'] = calculate_keyword_density(full_text, info_data['combined_keywords'])\n    return info_data\ndef calculate_keyword_density(text, keywords):\n    words = text.lower().split()\n    return {kw: (words.count(kw.lower()) / len(words)) * 100 for kw in keywords if len(words) > 0}"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 7\n\ndef chunk_summaries(chunks,\n                    max_length=None,\n                    min_length=None,\n                    truncation=False):"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 4 of 7\n\n    max_length = max_length or 160\n    min_length = min_length or 40\n    summaries = []\n    for idx, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n       \n            out = summarizer(\n                chunk,\n                max_length=max_length,\n                min_length=min_length,\n                truncation=truncation  # >>> explicitly drop over‑long parts if still above model limit\n            )\n            summaries.append(out[0][\"summary_text\"])\n   \n    return summaries"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 5 of 7\n\ndef split_to_chunk(full_text,max_words=None):\n    # split into sentence-ish bits\n    max_words = max_words or 300\n    sentences = text.split(\". \")\n    chunks, buf = [], \"\"\n    for sent in sentences:\n        # +1 for the “. ” we removed\n        if len((buf + sent).split()) <= max_words:\n            buf += sent + \". \"\n        else:\n            chunks.append(buf.strip())\n            buf = sent + \". \"\n    if buf:\n        chunks.append(buf.strip())\n    return chunks\ndef get_summary(full_text,\n                keywords=None,\n                info_data={},\n                max_words=None,\n                max_length=None,\n                min_length=None,\n                truncation=False):\n    info_data[\"summary\"] = None\n    if full_text and summarizer:\n        chunks = split_to_chunk(full_text,max_words=max_words)\n        summaries = chunk_summaries(chunks,\n                        max_length=max_length,\n                        min_length=min_length,\n                        truncation=truncation)\n        # stitch back together\n        info_data[\"summary\"] = \" \".join(summaries).strip()"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 6 of 7\n\n    return info_data"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 7 of 7\n\n\n"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: SEO_Optimization_and_Keyword_Extraction_Functions_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This portion of text_utils.py in the abstract_ocr package imports several functions and utilizes some of these to define new functions for text processing. The script loads the English model of spaCy for natural language processing and defines a function generate_with_bigbird to generate SEO-optimized titles, captions, descriptions, and abstracts using the pretrained BigBird model provided by the Hugging Face's Transformer library. A media URL generator is also defined, which can take a file system path and return a relative media URL for the file. Two other functions for keyword extraction are provided: get_keybert uses the pretrained KeyBERT model to extract key phrases by accepting a text string and adjustable parameters such as top_n (number of key phrases to return) and diversity (to diversify the resulting keywords), and extract_keywords_nlp applies part of speech tagging to extract most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 4\n\nfrom .text_utils import *\nfrom .audio_utils import *\nfrom .seo_utils import *\nfrom .ocr_utils import *\nfrom .functions import *\nfrom .audio_utils_clean import transcribe_audio_file_clean,transcribe_with_whisper_local\n# Clear root logger handlers to prevent duplicate console output\nlogging.getLogger('').handlers.clear()"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: SEO_Optimization_and_Keyword_Extraction_Functions_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This portion of text_utils.py in the abstract_ocr package imports several functions and utilizes some of these to define new functions for text processing. The script loads the English model of spaCy for natural language processing and defines a function generate_with_bigbird to generate SEO-optimized titles, captions, descriptions, and abstracts using the pretrained BigBird model provided by the Hugging Face's Transformer library. A media URL generator is also defined, which can take a file system path and return a relative media URL for the file. Two other functions for keyword extraction are provided: get_keybert uses the pretrained KeyBERT model to extract key phrases by accepting a text string and adjustable parameters such as top_n (number of key phrases to return) and diversity (to diversify the resulting keywords), and extract_keywords_nlp applies part of speech tagging to extract most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 2 of 4\n\n###json_data,chunk_length_ms=10000,renew=False\ndef transcribe_all_video_paths(directory=None,\n                               output_dir=None,\n                               remove_phrases=None,\n                               summarizer=None,\n                               kw_model=None,\n                               generator=None,\n                               LEDTokenizer=None,\n                               LEDForConditionalGeneration=None,\n                               uploader=None,\n                               domain=None,\n                               categories=None,\n                               videos_url=None,\n                               repository_dir=None,\n                               directory_links=None,\n                               videos_dir=None,\n                               infos_dir=None,\n                               base_url=None,\n                               chunk_length_ms=None,\n                               chunk_length_diff=None,\n                               title=None,\n                               renew=None,\n                               remove_text=None,\n                               video_id=None):\n    logger.info(f\"Entering transcribe_all_video_paths\")\n    directory = directory or os.getcwd()\n    paths = glob.glob(path_join(directory, '**', '**'), recursive=True)\n    paths = [file_path for file_path in paths if confirm_type(file_path,\n                                                              media_types=get_media_types(['video']))]\n    video_paths = get_all_file_types(directory=directory, types='video') or get_all_file_types(directory=directory, types='videos')\n    for video_path in video_paths:\n        transcribe_video_path(video_path=video_path,\n                              output_dir=output_dir,\n                              remove_phrases=remove_phrases,\n                              summarizer=summarizer,\n                              kw_model=kw_model,\n                              generator=generator,\n                              LEDTokenizer=LEDTokenizer,\n                              LEDForConditionalGeneration=LEDForConditionalGeneration,\n                              uploader=uploader,\n                              domain=domain,\n                              categories=categories,\n                              videos_url=videos_url,\n                              repository_dir=repository_dir,\n                              directory_links=directory_links,\n                              videos_dir=videos_dir,\n                              infos_dir=infos_dir,\n                              base_url=base_url,\n                              chunk_length_ms=chunk_length_ms,\n                              chunk_length_diff=chunk_length_diff,\n                              title = title,\n                              renew=renew,\n                              remove_text=remove_text,\n                              video_id=video_id)\n    logger.info(f\"Exiting transcribe_all_video_paths\")"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk.

It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: SEO_Optimization_and_Keyword_Extraction_Functions_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This portion of text_utils.py in the abstract_ocr package imports several functions and utilizes some of these to define new functions for text processing. The script loads the English model of spaCy for natural language processing and defines a function generate_with_bigbird to generate SEO-optimized titles, captions, descriptions, and abstracts using the pretrained BigBird model provided by the Hugging Face's Transformer library. A media URL generator is also defined, which can take a file system path and return a relative media URL for the file. Two other functions for keyword extraction are provided: get_keybert uses the pretrained KeyBERT model to extract key phrases by accepting a text string and adjustable parameters such as top_n (number of key phrases to return) and diversity (to diversify the resulting keywords), and extract_keywords_nlp applies part of speech tagging to extract most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 3 of 4\n\ndef transcribe_video_path(video_path,\n                          output_dir=None,\n                          remove_phrases=None,\n                          summarizer=None,\n                          kw_model=None,\n                          generator=None,\n                          LEDTokenizer=None,\n                          LEDForConditionalGeneration=None,\n                          uploader=None,\n                          domain=None,\n                          categories=None,\n                          videos_url=None,\n                          repository_dir=None,\n                          directory_links=None,\n                          videos_dir=None,\n                          infos_dir=None,\n                          base_url=None,\n                          chunk_length_ms=None,\n                          chunk_length_diff=None,\n                          title=None,\n                          renew=None,\n                          remove_text=None,\n                          video_id=None):\n    remove_phrases = remove_phrases or []\n    output_dir = output_dir if output_dir else make_dirs(directory, 'text_dir')\n    logger.info(f\"Processing video: {video_path}\")\n    info = get_info_data(video_path,\n                         output_dir=output_dir,\n                         remove_phrases=remove_phrases,\n                         uploader=uploader,\n                         domain=domain,\n                         categories=categories,\n                         videos_url=videos_url,\n                         chunk_length_ms=chunk_length_ms,\n                         chunk_length_diff=chunk_length_diff,\n                         title=title,\n                         renew=renew,\n                         video_id=video_id)\n    \n    if not os.path.isfile(info['audio_path']):\n        extract_audio_from_video(video_path=info['video_path'],\n                                 audio_path=info['audio_path'])\n    if info.get(\"whisper_result\") == None:\n        info = transcribe_with_whisper_local(\n                                            json_data=info,\n                                            audio_path=info['audio_path'],\n                                            model_size= \"small\",           # one of \"tiny\", \"base\", \"small\", \"medium\", \"large\"\n                                            language='english')\n    if info.get('video_text') == None:                                      \n        info = analyze_video_text(video_path=info['video_path'],\n                           output_dir=info['thumbnails_directory'],\n                           json_data=info,\n                           remove_phrases=info['remove_phrases'],\n                           video_id=info['video_id'])\n    if info.get(\"combined_keywords\") == None:\n        info = get_text_and_keywords(info,\n                                     summarizer=summarizer,\n                                     kw_model=kw_model)\n    if info.get('seo_description') == None:\n        info = get_seo_data(info,\n                            uploader=uploader,\n                            domain=domain,\n                            categories=categories,\n                            videos_url=videos_url,\n                            repository_dir=repository_dir,\n                            directory_links=directory_links,\n                            videos_dir=videos_dir,\n                            infos_dir=infos_dir,\n                            base_url=base_url,\n                            generator=generator,\n                            LEDTokenizer=LEDTokenizer,\n                            LEDForConditionalGeneration=LEDForConditionalGeneration)\n    safe_dump_to_file(data=info,\n                      file_path=info['info_path'])\n    return info"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: SEO_Optimization_and_Keyword_Extraction_Functions_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This portion of text_utils.py in the abstract_ocr package imports several functions and utilizes some of these to define new functions for text processing. The script loads the English model of spaCy for natural language processing and defines a function generate_with_bigbird to generate SEO-optimized titles, captions, descriptions, and abstracts using the pretrained BigBird model provided by the Hugging Face's Transformer library. A media URL generator is also defined, which can take a file system path and return a relative media URL for the file. Two other functions for keyword extraction are provided: get_keybert uses the pretrained KeyBERT model to extract key phrases by accepting a text string and adjustable parameters such as top_n (number of key phrases to return) and diversity (to diversify the resulting keywords), and extract_keywords_nlp applies part of speech tagging to extract most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 4 of 4\n\ndef get_info_data(video_path,\n                  output_dir=None,\n                  remove_phrases=None,\n                  uploader=None,\n                  domain=None,\n                  categories=None,\n                  videos_url=None,\n                  chunk_length_ms=None,\n                  chunk_length_diff=None,\n                  title=None,\n                  renew=None,\n                  remove_text=None,\n                  video_id=None):\n    remove_phrases = remove_phrases or []\n    remove_text = remove_text or False\n    basename = os.path.basename(video_path)\n    filename, ext = os.path.splitext(basename)\n    video_id = video_id or filename.replace(' ', '-').lower()\n    info_directory = make_dirs(output_dir, video_id)\n    thumbnails_directory = make_dirs(info_directory, 'thumbnails')\n    info_path = os.path.join(info_directory, 'info.json')\n    video_text_path = os.path.join(info_directory, 'video_text.json')\n    audio_path = os.path.join(info_directory, 'audio.wav')\n    video_json_path = os.path.join(info_directory, 'video_json.json')\n    categories = categories or {'ai': 'Technology', 'cannabis': 'Health', 'elon musk': 'Business'}\n    uploader = uploader or 'The Daily Dialectics'\n    domain = domain or 'https://thedailydialectics.com'\n    videos_url = videos_url or f\"{domain}/videos\"\n    canonical_url = f\"{videos_url}/{video_id}\"\n    chunk_length_ms = if_none_get_def(chunk_length_ms, 8000)\n    chunk_length_diff = if_none_get_def(chunk_length_diff, -5)\n    renew = if_none_get_def(renew, False)\n    info = {}\n    if os.path.isfile(info_path):\n        info = safe_read_from_json(info_path)\n    \n    info['parent_dir']=output_dir\n    info['video_path'] = video_path\n    info['info_directory'] = info_directory\n    info['thumbnails_directory']=thumbnails_directory\n    info['info_path'] = info_path\n    info['filename'] = video_id\n    info['ext'] = ext\n    info['title'] = title\n    info['remove_phrases'] = remove_phrases\n    info['audio_path'] = audio_path\n    info['video_json'] = video_json_path\n    info['categories'] = categories\n    info['uploader'] = uploader\n    info['domain'] = domain\n    info['videos_url'] = videos_url\n    info['video_id'] = video_id\n    info['canonical_url'] = canonical_url\n    info['chunk_length_ms'] = chunk_length_ms\n    info['chunk_length_diff'] = chunk_length_diff\n    info['renew'] = renew\n    safe_dump_to_file(data=info, file_path=info['info_path'])\n    return info"

The modules loaded include seo_utils, functions, video_utils, audio_utils, text_utils, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, transcribe_utils, repo_utils, and variable_utils. Each of these modules likely contains specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, video_utils might contain functions for video processing, ocr_utils likely contains tools for optical character recognition, and so on.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Processing_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script provided (\"audio_utils.py\") in the package \"abstract_ocr\" is mainly used for processing and transcribing audio data. It imports several functions from a local \"functions\" script. The module includes the following key functions: 1) \"get_audio_duration\" that returns the duration of a given audio file, 2) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" that loads an audio file, detects all non-silent ranges, transcribes each, and dumps the result into a JSON file, 3) \"chunk_fixed\" that splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap, 4) \"chunk_on_silence\" that loads an audio file and splits it on silent parts, 5) \"transcribe_in_chunks\" that transcribes audio by splitting the audio into chunks and stitching results, 6) \"transcribe_with_whisper_local\" that transcribes audio using the Whisper model, and 7) \"export_srt_whisper\" & \"export_srt\" that exports the transcription results into .srt files. This module is used in the overall OCR by transcribing spoken content in scanned documents or multimedia files.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Multimedia_Processing_and_Conversion_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given script chunk appears to be a portion of a larger application that is used for processing and converting multimedia files. The script primarily consists of a variety of import statements, module variables, and utility functions. Libraries imported into this script include image and text processing libraries like PIL, numpy, pytesseract, cv2, and pdf2image, audio processing libraries like pydub, and natural language processing libraries like KeyBERT and Transformers. It uses these libraries to manipulate and extract data from multimedia files.\\n\\nThe utility functions in this script are used for a variety of tasks, including manipulating and reasoning about file paths, computing percentages, cleaning text data, and updating JSON files. There are also constants used to define directory paths and URLs, as well as phrases to be removed from text. There are transformer pipelines set up for text summarization, keyword extraction, and text generation. Specialized functions, such as \"get_image_metadata\" and \"sort_frames\", are used for processing image files, while others like \"generate_file_id\" and \"update_json_data\" provide general utilities to the application. The functionality reveals a partial view of a bigger pipeline that handles multimedia data processing, transcription, and summarization; however, a full picture cannot be discerned until the subsequent chunks are analyzed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Optical_Character_Recognition_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script 'ocr_utils.py' from the package 'abstract_ocr' primarily involves several Optical Character Recognition (OCR) activities. It imports several functions from a local 'functions' script, as well as importing processing libraries like OpenCV and pytesseract.\n\nThe OCR process is as follows: 1) 'preprocess_for_ocr' function reads and preprocesses the image by enhancing the contrast, removing noise, thresholding, and sharpening - all using OpenCV functions. 2) 'extract_text_from_image' function processes the image for OCR and then makes use of pytesseract to extract text content from an image. 3) 'is_frame_analyzed' function is used to determine if a particular frame has been analyzed yet by comparing it with already processed frames. 4) 'extract_image_text' function primarily deals with the extraction of text from an image and text cleaning. 5) 'extract_text_from_frame' and 'extract_image_texts_from_directory' are setting up the pipeline to deal with multiple images residing in a single directory. 6) Other functions like 'download_pdf', 'preprocess_image', 'convert_image_to_text' offer additional utilities like the ability to download a PDF, preprocess an image, and convert the image to text respectively.\n\nThis module, overall, looks responsible for reading an image file along with its pre-processing and converting the file into a string of texts (ideally to get the data from the file for further analysis). It seems developed keeping in mind a batch-type processing operation where it will process multiple images with OCR in a single directory.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Part_1_Abstract_OCR_Audio_Transcription_and_Management_Feature\n was described as: The chunk provided is part 1 of the script from abstract_ocr and seems to play a vital part in the audio processing component of the module. The script revolves around processing and transcoding audio chunks with a well-defined set of methods and imported libraries such as \"moviepy.editor\", \"speech_recognition\", and \"pydub\". \\n\\nThe primary routines include \"get_audio_chunk\" that extracts specific audio pieces based on start and end times with noise correction; \"get_text\" which transcribes audio data to text using Google\\'s Speech Recognition; \"get_chunks\" for splitting the audio into specified chunks; \"get_chunk_period\" for determining the timeframe of a chunk and checking if it\\'s transcribed; \"get_audio_text\" and \"get_audio_text_data\" which deals with extracting the transcribed text from an audio chunk and appending it to the returned JSON file with timestamp details.\\n\\nThe script also includes helper methods like \"get_elapsed_time\", \"get_time_diff\", and \"check_if_transcribed_block\" that serve to organize and enhance the transcriptions and process tracking. The function \"get_audio_text_jsons\" is used for orchestrating the entire process of chunking, transcribing, and storing the results. The overall script plays the critical role of transcribing and logging timestamped audio data.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_clean.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Chunking_and_Transcription_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is part of \"audio_utils_clean.py\", from the \"abstract_ocr\" package. \\n\\nIt contains several functions used for processing and transcribing audio data: \\n\\n1) \"transcribe_audio_file_clean\" loads an audio file, calibrates for ambient noise based on the first second of the audio file, detects all non-silent ranges in the audio, transcribes each non-silent range, and optionally dumps into a JSON file. It accomplishes this task using several nested utilities such as the Recognizer from the SpeechRecognition library and AudioSegment from the pydub library.\\n\\n2) \"chunk_fixed\" splits a numpy audio array into fixed-size chunks with overlap.\\n\\n3) \"chunk_on_silence\" loads an audio file, dynamically sets a threshold for silence detection based on the average loudness of the audio track minus 16 dB, and splits the audio on silent parts. The function returns a list of pydub AudioSegment chunks. It also uses the function split_on_silence from the pydub library.\\n\\nOverall, these functions are written to aid in the transcription of audio data by first segmenting the audio track into manageable chunks which can be separately transcribed.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/audio_utils_old.py\n dubbed with the title: Audio_Transcription_and_Text_Summarization_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The script \"audio_utils_old.py\" is part of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. It is designed to handle the process of transcribing audio data from video files. Some of the imported modules include \"os\", \"glob\", \"logging\", \"json\", \"spacy\", \"SpeechRecognition\", and \"pydub\". The script sets up logging properties at the start, and initialises the speech recognizer. \\n\\nThe prominent routine in this chunk is \"transcribe_audio_file\", which takes an audio file as an input, divides it into chunks of specified length, and transcribes each chunk into text using Google\\'s speech recognition API. If the transcription fails due to unknown values or API errors, it logs an appropriate message and continues with the next chunk. The transcriptions are then saved in both plain text and JSON formats. \\n\\nThe function also includes summarization and keyword extraction features, which can be used optionally. This indicates that there might be further text analysis and summarization of the transcriptions planned in the full module. Error handling mechanisms are also in place to log any issues during the transcription or summarization processes.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/download_pdf.py\n dubbed with the title: Placeholder_or_Incomplete_Code\n was described as: The chunk of code provided doesn\"t contain enough information to provide a comprehensive summary or description. It appears to be a placeholder or incorrectly copied script as it does not contain any python code or comments.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/linetest.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_to_Text_Conversion_Using_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script 'linetest.py' in the package 'abstract_ocr' performs image-to-text conversion on a given image file using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability of Tesseract. It starts with importing necessary libraries including cv2, numpy, pytesseract and PIL.\\n\\nThe script proceeds with these major steps:\\n\\n1) Load the image file from a defined path.\\n\\n2) Preprocess the image for better OCR results. The preprocessing activities include converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur for noise reduction and adaptive thresholding for contrast enhancement.\\n\\n3) Perform OCR using the pytesseract library with certain custom configurations to obtain OCR data. This data includes bounding boxes and confidence scores.\\n\\n4) Identify and print the rows containing high-confidence words.\\n\\nThis script is an essential part of the OCR process as it is responsible for reading, preprocessing, and converting an image to text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/macros.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Path_Management_in_Abstract_OCR_Macros\n was described as: The provided script \"macros.py\" from the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 part of src/abstract_ocr/old/ sets up for managing video paths, primarily through a class named \"videoPathManager\". This script consists of setup for directory paths/navigation utilities for video files, organized in a Python class. It uses libraries for interacting with the file system and handling JSON data, such as \"os\", \"pathlib\", \"shutil\", \"hashlib\", and custom function like \"safe_read_from_json\", \"safe_dump_to_file\".\\n\\nA key element in this script is the class \"videoPathManager\", which encapsulates the logic for managing video paths. The class has methods for getting all video paths and getting the path of a particular video. Upon initialization, video IDs are fetched from the directory specified by TEXT_DIR, and the get_all_video_paths method maps these video IDs to their respective directories, fetching additional information from a JSON file. Additionally, the \"get_video_path\" method returns the path information for a specific video given the video ID. logger is also set up for keeping track of events in a log file.\\n\\nNotably, this script communicates with a specific directory structure, suggesting it\\'s designed to operate within a specific project environment. Overall, this file likely plays a key role in managing and abstracting the file system operations of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. Infrastructure like this would be useful in a larger application working with a large number of files in a specific directory hierarchy.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/old/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Text_Analysis_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script comes from \"video_utils.py\", part of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1. This script mainly focuses on processing video files for optical character recognition (OCR) purposes. The script starts with importing necessary libraries such as cv2, pytesseract, os, shutil, logging, spacy, json, re, some specific functions from the folder abstract_utilities, and ocr_utils.\\n\\nThe functionality provided in this part of the script includes several auxiliary functions like: \\n\\n1) \"determine_remove_text\": Determines and removes certain phrases from the provided text.\\n\\n2) \"extract_hash_tags\": Extracts hashtags from a given string.\\n\\n3) \"get_title_description\": Splits the provided string into a title and description based on a specified length.\\n\\n4) \"is_frame_analyzed\": Checks if a particular frame has been analyzed by comparing it with already processed frames.\\n\\n5) \"analyze_video_text\": This is the main function that uses all the above functions and additional logic to analyze text from video frame-by-frame and stores the results in a specified output directory or in the directory of the video file. Details of analysis include text, title, description, and hashtags from each frame.\\n\\nBy collaborating with other utilities in abstract_ocr package, this script possibly plays a part in analyzing text and keywords from video files for further multimedia data processing and analysis.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: PDF_Conversion_Functionality_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package. This script is responsible for handling PDF-related functionalities.\n\nIt starts with importing necessary modules and functions. Modules imported include 'argparse' for parser arguments, 'Image' for image processing, 'os' for operating system related tasks, and 'PyPDF2' for working with PDFs. It also imports two functions 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions.py' script, and 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils.py' script.\n\nThe defined function 'images_to_pdf' takes image paths and an output pdf file as arguments. The function is supposed to convert a list of image files into a PDF file; however, the full function definition is not shown in this script chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/repo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Repository_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The 'repo_utils.py' script from the 'abstract_ocr' package provides utility operations to support the functionalities of this OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module. It imports functions from several other utility modules included in the package. These include the 'functions.py' script, which seems to provide general utilities such as updating JSON data and generating file IDs; the 'variable_utils.py' script, a module for generating and handling application-specific variables; the 'video_utils.py' script, which evidently is for video-to-text transcriptions and analysis; the 'audio_utils.py' script, which seemingly manages audio-to-text transcriptions, specifically with the Whisper model; the 'text_utils.py' script, included for text refinement and summarization operations; and the 'seo_utils.py' script, aiming to handle SEO-related actions. \\n\\nHowever, specific usages of these imported modules and functions are not provided in this script chunk. The full scope of 'repo_utils.py' can only be determined after reviewing the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/routes.py\n dubbed with the title: Import_Module_Level_Names_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The provided script does not contain any substantial code. It simply includes an import statement that imports all the module-level names from the current package. This could potentially make all the functions, classes and variables available in the current module from the package\"s top level, creating a convenient namespace. The specific functions, classes, and variables that are made available through this import statement will depend on the contents of the __init__.py file in this package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Utility_Modules_in_Seo_Utils_Part_1\n was described as: The given script chunk from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package is the first part of five and primarily involves import statements. This script import several utility modules including text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils, which are part of the same package. These modules likely contain specific functions and tools related to their respective fields. For instance, text_utils might contain functions for text processing and analysis, audio_utils likely contains tools for audio processing and transcription, and video_utils might contain functions for video processing and OCR related tasks. However, as the given chunk does not include any actual functionality or usage of these imported modules, a more detailed description would require analysis of the succeeding chunks and the specific modules imported here.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Text_Processing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This is the part of the text_utils.py script from the Abstract OCR package that includes a set of functions for text processing. The script imports necessary modules and utilities from other files in the package such as the logger function for logging and the keras model for keyword extraction. Then, it defines function - generate_media_url for generating a media URL given a file system path. The script also includes several other functions such as \\`refine_with_gpt\\` for refining text generation using the GPT model, \\`generate_with_bigbird\\` for generating text with the BigBird model, and \\`get_keybert\\` that incorporates KeyBERT model to extract keywords. Besides, the semantic role labeling function \\`get_keybert\\` is used to extract the roles of different parts within the given text. The function \\`extract_keywords_nlp\\` uses NLP to extract the most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_and_Setting_Up_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The given script from abstract_ocr is generally involved in setting up necessary modules and handlers for the running of the package. It imports several scripts: text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, and ocr_utils, in addition to functions. These utilities likely contain specific functions related to their areas. For instance, text_utils is probably for text processing, audio_utils for audio processing, seo_utils for handling SEO-related actions, and ocr_utils for optical character recognition. The script also imports specific functions from audio_utils, namely transcribe_audio_file_clean and transcribe_with_whisper_local, which are likely for transcribing audio files. The script also clears root logger handlers, probably to prevent duplicate console output, indicating the setup for logging in the applications run. However, specifics about its implementation or operational methods are not visible within this chunk.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/variable_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Variable_Utils_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk_1\n was described as: The given code chunk is from variable_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\". This file imports all functions from \".functions\", which is a local module in the same package. The functions module likely contains a variety of utility functions for the package. These could range anywhere from image and text processing functions, to audio and video utilities, or other general utility functions. Specific details about these functions are not provided in this chunk. Since this is only a portion of the variable_utils.py file, additional context or code is needed to fully understand its purpose and functionality in the abstract_ocr package.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/abstract_ocr/video_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Video_Analysis_and_Thumbnail_Selection_in_Abstract_OCR_Video_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The script chunk provided is the first part of two from video_utils.py in the package 'abstract_ocr'. It primarily involves processing video data and text analysis from videos. After importing requisite functions from the module, three main functions defined include 'clip_frames', 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim'. 'clip_frames' shortens a list of sorted resources returned from video frame processing. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' generates an optimal image thumbnail from the video frames based on a scoring metric evaluating relatability to given keyword inputs and clarity of the text associated with the frame. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' seems to be a more streamlined version of 'pick_optimal_thumbnail', focusing specifically on text provided with the video. The analyzed video frames are then sorted, and the one with the highest score is picked as the thumbnail. Additionally, an 'analyze_video_text' function is set for extracting video frames, generating images, and analyzing them. It collaborates with other utility functions from the 'abstract_ocr' package to extract video frames, convert them to image files, and analyse the text data in those frames.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/__init__.py\n dubbed with the title: Init_Script_in_Abstract_OCR_v0.0.1.1\n was described as: The __init__.py file from src/old/__init__.py of the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1 consists of imports from several utility modules, essentially setting up the main run environment. The modules being loaded include audio_utils, functions, ocr_utils, pdf_utils, seo_utils, text_utils, and transcribe_utils, with an additional import from audio_utils_clean. Each of these modules is likely responsible for different functions and tools needed for the overall functioning of the \"abstract_ocr\" package. For instance, audio_utils may contain functions for audio processing and transcriptions, ocr_utils would contain functionalities for optical character recognition, text_utils for text processing and analysis, functions for a variety of general utility functions and so on. The additional import from audio_utils_clean suggests a clean, perhaps refactored version of some audio processing utilities. However, without examining the individual modules, the exact functionalities encapsulated within each cannot be accurately determined.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/audio_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Functions_in_Abstract_OCR_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the 'abstract_ocr' package. This chunk is mainly importing a number of functions from the existing '.functions' module. The imported functions include 'os' for handling operating system tasks, 'logger' for logging events, 'whisper' possibly for whispered audio transcription, 'AudioSegment' for creating and exporting audio segments, 'sr' (speech recognition) for converting speech into text, 'detect_nonsilent' to detect nonsilent parts within an audio segment, 'format_timestamp' to convert timestamp into a specific format, 'safe_dump_to_file' for saving data to the file system, 'List' for generating lists, 'shutil' for high-level file operations, and '_format_srt_timestamp' likely to convert timestamps into SubRip (.srt) time format. The details of how these functions are used would be clearer in the subsequent chunks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/functions.py\n dubbed with the title: Central_Utility_Hub_in_Abstract_OCR_Functions_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a portion of functions.py under the abstract_ocr package, which contains a variety of import statements, functions and tools that likely constitute core functionalities of the package. \\n\\nThis script primarily imports various necessary modules such as spacy for natural language processing tasks, pytesseract for optical character recognition, cv2 for image and video processing, PyPDF2 for handling PDF files, argparse for handling command-line arguments, whisper which might relate to whispered speech recognition, shutil and os for handling operating system tasks, sys for system-specific parameters and functions, json for handling JSON data, glob for handling directory and file paths, hashlib for hashing functions, and datetime for handling date and time. Additionally, it imports functions from other custom modules like abstract_math, abstract_utilities, keybert and transformers, which likely offer various functionalities tailored towards the application\\'s specific needs. In essence, the functions module seems to serve as a central utility hub for the abstract_ocr package, offering functionalities ranging from file handling and mathematics computations, to multimedia processing and machine learning tasks.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/ocr_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Image_Preprocessing_for_OCR_in_Abstract_OCR\n was described as: The script chunk provided is a segment from ocr_utils.py in the package \"abstract_ocr\" version 0.0.1.1, and this is the first chunk out of eight. It mainly involves importing necessary functions from the module 'functions.py' and defining a function for preprocessing images for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The imported functions include 'clean_text', 're', 'write_to_file', 'cv2', 'np', 'pytesseract', 'Image', and 'sort_frames'. The defined function 'preprocess_for_ocr' takes an image path and conducts preprocessing tasks to prepare it for OCR. It reads the image, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV, and returns the processed image in the form of a numpy array. This function is likely essential in the initial stages of the OCR process, ensuring images are correctly formatted for effective character recognition.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/pdf_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_and_Defining_PDF_Conversion_Function_in_Abstract_OCR_Pdf_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is a part of the module 'pdf_utils.py' from the 'abstract_ocr' package, which serves as a processing tool for PDF-related tasks. In this chunk, necessary modules and functions are imported, including 'argparse', 'Image', 'os', 'PyPDF2', 'clean_text' and 'write_to_file' from the 'functions' script, as well as 'preprocess_image' and 'convert_image_to_text' from the 'ocr_utils' script. A function named 'images_to_pdf' is defined, which requires image paths and an output PDF file as its parameters. This function is meant to convert a list of image files into a PDF. However, the entire implementation of the function is not visible in this chunk, but from the input arguments and the initial error handling, it can be inferred that this function likely deals with verifying input data, preprocessing images, and converting processed images into a PDF.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/seo_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Importing_Modules_in_Abstract_OCR_Seo_Utils_Chunk1\n was described as: The provided script chunk is the first part out of five from seo_utils.py in the \"abstract_ocr\" package. This chunk primarily consists of importing modules. It imports text_utils, audio_utils, and video_utils from the same package. Respectively, these modules probably contain specific functions and tools related to their areas, such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, and video processing and OCR for video_utils. As this chunk only involves import statements and does not highlight any actual functionalities or use of the imported modules, further chunks would need to be reviewed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of seo_utils.py.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/text_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: SEO_Optimization_and_Keyword_Extraction_Functions_Abstract_OCR_Text_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: This portion of text_utils.py in the abstract_ocr package imports several functions and utilizes some of these to define new functions for text processing. The script loads the English model of spaCy for natural language processing and defines a function generate_with_bigbird to generate SEO-optimized titles, captions, descriptions, and abstracts using the pretrained BigBird model provided by the Hugging Face's Transformer library. A media URL generator is also defined, which can take a file system path and return a relative media URL for the file. Two other functions for keyword extraction are provided: get_keybert uses the pretrained KeyBERT model to extract key phrases by accepting a text string and adjustable parameters such as top_n (number of key phrases to return) and diversity (to diversify the resulting keywords), and extract_keywords_nlp applies part of speech tagging to extract most common nouns and proper nouns from the text.\n\n/n/n in the script: src/old/transcribe_utils.py\n dubbed with the title: Setting_Up_Main_Run_Environment_for_Abstract_OCR_Transcribe_Utils_Chunk_1\n was described as: The provided script is a part of the \\'transcribe_utils.py\\' file from the \\'abstract_ocr\\' package. This file mainly imports necessary modules like text_utils, audio_utils, seo_utils, ocr_utils. These modules likely contain functions and tools related to their areas such as text processing and analysis for text_utils, audio processing and transcription for audio_utils, SEO-related actions for seo_utils, and optical character recognition for ocr_utils. This script also imports two specific transcription-related functions from \\'audio_utils_clean.py\\'. Additionally, the script clears the root logger handlers, likely to prevent duplicate console output in the running environment. Overall, this script plays a critical role in setting up the main run environment for the OCR-related package by importing necessary modules and preparation.\n\n/n/n\n\nplease overview the script provided in the chunk_data and derive a description/summary of the script as it relates to the module; this will later be amalgamated with the various portions of the whole module descriptions to create a comprehensive readme\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#chunk_data#\n\nthis is chunk 1 of 1\n\nfrom .functions import (VideoFileClip,\n                        cv2,\n                        os,\n                        np,\n                        math)\nfrom .ocr_utils import extract_image_texts_from_directory\ndef clip_frames(items,initial=None,end=None):\n    initial = initial or 35\n    end = end or 35\n    items_length = len(items)\n    if items_length> initial:\n        items = items[initial:]\n    items_length = len(items)\n    if items_length> end:\n        items = items[:-end]\n    return items\ndef pick_optimal_thumbnail(whisper_result, directory, *args,keywords=None,initial=None,end=None,**kwargs):\n    scores = []\n    keywords = keywords or []\n    dirbase = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(directory))\n    image_files = sort_frames(directory=directory)\n    image_files = clip_frames(image_files)\n    first_image_file = image_files[0]\n    thumb_name,thumb_ext = os.path.splitext(os.listdir(directory)[0])\n    # Process each Whisper segment\n    for segment in whisper_result[\"segments\"]:\n        text = segment[\"text\"].lower().strip()\n        start_time = segment[\"start\"]        # Find the closest thumbnail based on start time\n        frame_number = math.floor(start_time)\n        thumbnail_name = f\"{dirbase}_frame_{frame_number}{thumb_ext}\"\n        \n        # Check if thumbnail exists\n        if thumbnail_name not in thumbnails:\n            continue\n        \n        # Score the caption\n        keyword_score = sum(1 for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in text)\n        clarity_score = 1 if len(text) > 20 else 0\n        end_phrase_penalty = -1 if \"thanks for watching\" in text else 0\n        total_score = keyword_score + clarity_score + end_phrase_penalty\n        \n        # Store thumbnail path, score, and caption\n        thumbnail_path = os.path.join(directory, thumbnail_name)\n        scores.append((thumbnail_path, total_score, text))\n       \n    # Sort by score (highest first)\n    scores = sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    return scores[0] if scores else None\ndef pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim(video_text,\n                           combined_keywords):\n    scores = []\n    for entry in video_text:\n        \n        text = entry['text'].lower()\n        \n        keyword_score = sum(1 for kw in combined_keywords if kw.lower() in text)\n        \n        clarity_score = 1 if len(text.strip()) > 20 else 0  # basic clarity check\n        \n        end_phrase_penalty = -1 if \"thanks for watching\" in text else 0\n        \n        total_score = keyword_score + clarity_score + end_phrase_penalty\n        \n        scores.append((entry['frame'],\n                       total_score,\n                       text.strip()))\n    scores = sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    return scores[0] if scores else None\ndef extract_video_frames(video_path,output_directory,frame_interval=None):\n    frame_interval = frame_interval or = 1\n    video = VideoFileClip(video_path)\n    duration = video.duration\n    for t in range(0, int(duration), frame_interval):\n        frame_path = os.path.join(output_directory,f\"{video_id}_frame_{t}.jpg\")\n        if not os.path.isfile(frame_path):\n            frame = video.get_frame(t)\n            cv2.imwrite(frame_path, cv2.cvtColor(np.array(frame), cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR))\ndef analyze_video_text(video_path,\n                       output_directory=None,\n                       image_texts=None,\n                       remove_phrases=None,\n                       video_id=None,\n                       frame_interval=None):\n    if video_path == None or not video_path or not os.path.isfile(video_path):\n        return image_texts\n    remove_phrases=remove_phrases or []\n    output_directory = output_directory or os.getcwd()\n    \n    extract_video_frames(video_path=video_path,\n                          output_directory=output_directory,\n                          frame_interval=frame_interval)\n    image_texts = extract_image_texts_from_directory(output_directory=output_directory,\n                                                     image_texts=image_texts,\n                                                     remove_phrases=remove_phrases)\n    \n    return image_texts\ndef get_video_metadata(file_path):\n    video = mp.VideoFileClip(file_path)\n    \n    metadata = {\n        'resolution': f\"{video.w}x{video.h}\",\n        'format': 'MP4',\n        'file_size_mb': os.path.getsize(file_path) / (1024 * 1024)\n    }\n    \n    video.close()\n    return metadata\n"

This script focuses on extracting and analyzing video frames for optical character recognition (OCR). \n\nMany functions are defined in this script to accomplish this goal. The 'clip_frames' function clips the first and last frames when there are too many. 'pick_optimal_thumbnail' and 'pick_optimal_thumbnail_slim' use a scoring mechanism based on keyword frequency, clarity, introducing the end of video, to select an optimal frame as the video's thumbnail. The 'extract_video_frames' function extracts frames from video files at a given frame interval using the moviepy library. The 'analyze_video_text' function directs the overall process of extracting video frames and analyzing their text. It also guides the process for preparing the video frames for OCR through 'extract_image_texts_from_directory'. Lastly, 'get_video_metadata' retrieves metadata of a given video file, including its resolution, format, and file size.\n\nProcessing video frames through these functions effectively transforms a video into an array of frame images, each with relevant textual information.
